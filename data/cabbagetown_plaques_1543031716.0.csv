0,"Writer, Self-trained Biologist, Scientific Illustrator and Naturalist",Ernest Thompson Seton  1860 - 1946,"Ernest Thompson Seton is one of the most important 19th-Century Toronto novelists.Seton began his career as a scientific illustrator and was a self-trained biologist.From the 1890s until his death he wrote about 60 books, and nearly 400 magazine articles and short stories. His book Wild Animals I Have Known, first published in 1898, has never been out of print. His dramatic wilderness stories brought him praise from such notable contemporaries as Andrew Carnegie, Rudyard Kipling, Theodore Roosevelt, Leo Tolstoy and Mark Twain.It is said that he had an almost mystical reverence for wolves and ‘Indians’ (the word used at the time). He thought that wolves were the most clever and noble of creatures and eventually called himself ‘Black Wolf.’ Indians to him were the finest people because of their understanding of, and respect for, nature.As one of the founders of the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides of America, he inspired children to imitate the Indians’ ways.The message that Ernest Thompson Seton delivered for 60 years was that nature is a great gift and should be valued and protected. One of the more thought-provoking phenomena of the 20th century is the remarkable extent to which we have become a nation of nature lovers.In his time, Ernest Thompson Seton did more than his share to help this cause along.The E.T. Seton Park near the Ontario Science Centre is named in his honour. A plaque was also installed in Lindsay where his family settle after emigrating from England.Hear him talk:","6 Aberdeen Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/test-person-1/
1,Renowned Canadian Sculptor,"Walter Seymour Allward, R.C.A.  1876 - 1955","Walter Seymour Allward has been referred to as the Dean of Canadian Sculptors, and no doubt, one of the most important of this century. Born in Toronto in 1876, he attended Central Technical School. Mr. Allward then studied under prominent Canadian sculptors William Cruikshank and Emmanuel Hahn, and later in London, England, and Paris, France.Allward first worked or apprenticed as a draftsman for the architectural firm Gibson and Simpson before working at the Don Valley Brickworks where he modelled terra cotta decorative panels.His first commission at 19 years of age was the figure of “Peace” on the North-West Rebellion Monument which is located in Queen’s Park, Toronto (1895). His other early works included the “Old Soldier“, commemorating the War of 1812 in Portland Square, Toronto (1903); and a life-sized figure of Dr. Oronhyatekha (chief ranger) commissioned by the Independent Order of Foresters (1899).Now well established he received commissions to do busts of Lord Tennyson, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir Wilfred Laurier and others. On the grounds of Queen’s Park are statues of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe (1903), Sir Oliver Mowat (1905), John Sandfield Macdonald (1909), and William Lyon Mackenzie (1940).Allward was elected as associate of the Royal Canadian Academy in 1903. His diploma work, “The Storm” (c1920, bronze) is in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.His heroic monuments include the South African War Memorial on University Avenue, the Baldwin-Lafontaine Monument on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and the King Edward VII memorial in Ottawa.Walter Allward’s most important commission was the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, a monument to Canadians killed in the First World War built in Vimy, France (April 1917). Vimy Ridge’s impressive location and vantage point as much as the battle’s significance contributed to its selection. He began to sculpt the figures in clay in a studio in London, England. The clearing of the dangerous 100 hectare site of unexploded bombs, artillery shells, and grenades took two and a half years. It also took two years to find a suitable stone for the memorial. Eventually it was found in a quarry near Sarajevo, Yugoslavia where in 1914, the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife had precipitated the outbreak of the First World War.It took fourteen years and $1.5 million dollars to complete. Designed in the early 1920’s, construction started in 1925 and was completed in 1936Canadian National Vimy MemorialAllward stated in a 1921 interview that his idea for the memorial was inspired by a wartime dream that he had never forgotten: “When things were at their blackest in France, I went to sleep one night after dwelling on all the muck and misery over there, my spirit was like a thing tormented… I dreamed I was in a great battlefield. I saw our men going in by the thousands and being mowed down by the sickles of death… Suffering beyond endurance at the sight, I turned my eyes and found myself looking down on an avenue of poplars. Suddenly through the avenue I saw thousands marching to the aid of our armies. They were the dead. They rose in masses, filed silently by and entered the fight to aid the living. So vivid was this impression, that when I awoke it stayed with me for months. Without the dead we were helpless. So I have tried to show this in this monument to Canada’s fallen, what we owed them and we will forever owe them.”Known as “ Allward of Vimy” Walter Allward’s greatest works have become a vibrant part of our national heritage.Allward appears as himself in the novel The Stone Carvers by Canadian author Jane Urquhart.A few other plaques honour Allward. One was installed in the median on University Avenue near Queen Street. Another is in Brantford at the Bell Memorial Gardens. A plaque has also been installed near his grave in the Saint John’s Anglican (York Mills) Church Cemetery in the northern part of the city.The unveiling and dedication by King Edward VIII of the Canadian National Vimy Monument on July 26, 1836.Hear him talk:","43 Amelia Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/walter-seymour-allward/
2,World-Renowned Innovator of Ballet Education,Betty Oliphant  1918 - 2004,"Betty Oliphant was born into a prominent family in London, England. Sadly for her, she never knew her father, who died shortly after she was born. She had a passion for dance and fought her middle-class British family for ballet lessons.In the late nineteen twenties and thirties she studied ballet along with stage, tap and ballroom dancing. When she was thirteen years old, she was teaching and dancing professionally, and at seventeen years of age she opened her own school above the Twinings Tea Emporium in London, England. At the age of twenty, she found that she was far too tall for classic dance.During the Second World War she worked as an ambulance driver, as a choreographer of pantomimes, and also for a British Army touring group, “The Blue Pencils”.When the war was over, Betty came to Canada as a war bride with her Canadian husband (a soldier) and her two children. She then opened a school on Sherbourne Street, and helped found the Canadian Dance Teachers Association.Betty Oliphant was the ballet mistress for eight years and later the Associate Artistic Director of the National Ballet of Canada, established by Celia Franca. She was a fabulous teacher but had a reputation as being a very difficult task master. Central to her approach as a ballet teacher was the importance of mastering technique, with the sole purpose of achieving freedom of expression.In 1959 “Miss O,” as she was called, co-founded the National Ballet School with Celia Franca. It was successful beyond their expectations, providing the best dance training and academic schooling combined. Among Miss Oliphant’s early students were, Robert Desrosiers, Karen Kain, James Kudelka, Veronica Tennant, Rex Harrington, and John Aleyne, a choreographer.Betty Oliphant’s legacy is huge. All her work has been an uncompromising quest for excellence and insistence upon the highest standards. She put Canadian Ballet training on the world map and broadened its definition to include the education of the whole person.Awards and HonoursThe National Ballet School’s theatre is called the Betty Oliphant Theatre.Hear her talk:","137 Amelia Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/betty-oliphant/

5,"Comedian and Actor, Co-Founder of the Royal Canadian Air Farce",Roger Abbott  1946 - 2011,"“May The Farce Be With You!”Roger Abbott was born in Birkenhead, England. In 1953, his family emigrated to Canada and Roger grew up in Montreal. He attended Loyola High School and Loyola College where he met Don Ferguson, co-star and co-founder of the Royal Canadian Air Farce.While in university, Roger developed an obsession for working in radio. He began his broadcasting career in off-air programming and management in a private radio station. He stumbled into comedy in 1970 when comedians John Morgan and Martin Bronstein convinced him to join the cast of the improvisational theatre revue called The Jest Society, (a pun on then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s goal of making Canada a “Just Society”).The cast rapidly underwent changes and, by January 1971, had firmed up with Abbott, Bronstein, Morgan, Don Ferguson and Luba Goy. Dave Broadfoot joined when the show moved to radio in the fall of 1973 and became known as the Royal Canadian Air Farce.  In 1974, Martin Bronstein left the group and, in the late 1980s, Dave Broadfoot stepped aside as well.For several years the Air Farce recorded at the Curtain Club in Richmond Hill, then switched to CBC’s Parliament Street studio in Toronto; it eventually spent many years taping “on the road” in cities and towns across Canada.The weekly broadcast, which was always recorded in front of a live audience, ran for 24 seasons on CBC Radio. Don Ferguson called Roger “the guiding light of Royal Canadian Air Farce.” His talents were many and he possessed a unique combination of artistic, organizational and business skills. And, of course, he was funny!In 1993, the Air Farce made the jump to a weekly television series on CBC and became an instant hit. It ran for 16 seasons and was consistently the highest-rated Canadian comedy series.The troupe also played cross-Canada live tours and recorded several comedy albums.
Some of Roger Abbott’s most famous characters, among the dozens of real-life people he portrayed, were: the Queen Mother, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Leonard Cohen, U.S. President George W. Bush, CBC news anchor Peter Mansbridge, and whoever happened to be Pope. Among his fictitious characters were TV critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me, one half of the Jimmy and Shamus News From Away News Team (with Don Ferguson), First Nations Spokesman “Billy Two Willies” and his beloved sugar-addicted Doughnut Shop regular.Roger has been described as a game changer in the world of Canadian comedy. He especially made the country laugh during the election campaigns. The Farce members were forerunners of political satire in Canada and they made the country laugh for almost four decades.From 1992 to present day, Canadians have celebrated the New Year with the annual Air Farce New Year’s Special on CBC television, which like both radio and TV series, continues to be performed before a live audience.Roger’s favourite charity was Easter Seals Ontario. He was committed to helping children with physical disabilities and was an ardent supporter for more than 30 years. Both Roger and Don Ferguson were jointly honoured as the 2008 recipients of the distinguished Easter Seals Toronto’s Tribute, one that honours excellence for their support of children and youth with physical disabilities. For over 25 years, they hosted the Easter Seals Telethon on CBC television.Abbott co-wrote with Don Ferguson the book Air Farce: 40 Years of Flying by the Seat of Our Pants and it was published in 2011. It’s a memoir full of anecdotes, photographs, scripts, and other memorabilia.Roger loved life, especially his frequent trips to Italy. And he particularly enjoyed his years living on Amelia Street. He was an avid historian of Toronto and could tell many an anecdote about the creation and development of his beloved Cabbagetown neighbourhood.His untimely death in 2011 was a shock to all who knew him personally or as a comedian. In honour of his passing and to mark his contribution to the artistic life of the country, the National Arts Centre in Ottawa flew its flag at half-mast.Shawn Majumder of CBC TV This Hour Has 22 Minutes said that “his impact on Canadian television, radio and comedy in general is so huge, it’s so massive and so rooted in Canadian culture, that his life will be celebrated for a very, very long time.”Awards and Honours","132 Amelia Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/roger-abbott/
6,A Giant in Canadian Broadcast Journalism,Gordon Sinclair  1900 - 1984,"One of the biggest names in Canadian broadcast journalism is Gordon Sinclair. In 1922 he began working as a reporter for the Toronto Daily Star. He had a series of assignments in the late twenties and thirties that sent him around the world four times as a wandering reporter. He traveled 360,000 miles, through all continents, and on all oceans except the Antarctic. From these adventures he wrote the following four books: Footloose In India, Cannibal Quest, Loose Among the Devils and Khyber Caravan.His career took a turn in 1942 and he began working in radio. He reported on the raid on Dieppe, and he was then asked to write biographical sketches of leaders in that raid. The result was a mid-day personality series – Let’s Be Personal, on Canada’s radio station CFRB which attracted huge audiences, and which continued until the time of his death.At this time, Gordon Sinclair was still working for the newspaper. After 21 years as a newspaperman he quit the Toronto Star and opted for a free-lance career in radio.In 1948, CFRB granted Gordon Sinclair a leave and he took a fifth trip around the world, traveling to Japan, China, Malaya, and on to Europe. He witnessed the takeover of China by the communists.In 1957 he became a charter member of Front Page Challenge, a weekly panel show on the CBC TV network. It was Canada’s longest running television program, which continued until 1995.“Sinc’s” most famous commentary was broadcast in 1973 when anti-American sentiment was at an all-time high. The piece was echoed around the world and is considered one of the most respected tributes from Canada to the people of the United States of America. Its renewed popularity in September 2001 can be attributed to recent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.Hear him talk:","327-355 Carlton Street, Toronto, ON M5A 3W3, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/gordon-sinclair/

10,Pioneer Ecologist,Charles Sauriol  1904 - 1995,"The plaque was situated at the east end of Carlton Street, near to the top of the stairs going down the park. It was recently damaged and will be replaced in the near future.Charles Sauriol was born in Toronto, Ontario, and was the youngest of seven children. In 1882, his father had moved to Toronto to work as an engineer on the dredging of the Don River.Once in Toronto, the Sauriols lived on Gerrard Street where it intersects with Sumach Street. Charles went to Sacré-Coeur School. As a young boy he camped out in the Don Valley with the 45th East Toronto Troop of the Boy Scouts. It was at this time that he fell in love with the Don Valley, which at the time was woods, some farms, and in its natural state.In 1927, Charles Sauriol purchased his own piece of the Don – a piece of railway land on 40 hectares at the forks of the river. He used it as a cottage. For years he spent his summers there with his family. Only four trees stood on site in 1927. Sauriol began an ambitious project of reforestation, planting shrubs, native hard woods and conifers on the slope surrounding the cottage.As ancestors of his had emigrated to New France from Brittany in 1705, Charles was 8th generation Canadian, and completely bilingual. He spent 30 years working as a marketing director for French publishing houses like Porier Bessette in Montreal. He penned and published a Weekly dedicated to stories of the Don Valley, called Le Samedi.In 1949, Charles Sauriol co-founded the Don Valley Conservation Association. The mission was to preserve the Don Valley as a natural forest. Sauriol organized trips by steam locomotive to raise money. These trips began at the Don River station near Queen Street and attracted up to a thousand passengers, who traveled to such places as Cobourg, Lindsay, and Niagara Falls.In 1954, he joined forces with the Don Valley Conservation Authority. It became the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1957. During the 1950s, the MTCA purchased most of the valleys and ravines that today make up Toronto’s green belt. Much of this was a direct consequence of Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Widespread damage gave new urgency to flood control measures, the MTCA wanted to remove houses from risky floodplain areas.In 1958 plans for the Don Valley Parkway bisected the Sauriol cottage property and they were forced to vacate their beloved cottage. It was demolished the same year.Soon after, in 1966, Charles Sauriol helped establish the Nature Conservancy of Canada. During this period he was its primary fundraiser. He helped the Conservancy acquire parkland across Canada. In Ontario alone, he purchased 500 properties. Over the course of his career, he led fundraising campaigns that netted more than 200 million dollars dedicated to the preservation of green space.Charles Sauriol’s work as an ecologist was well recognized. He was known as “Mr. Conservation.” And in 1989 he received the Order of Canada. He earned 40 other awards and citations. Today four green spaces, a park and a Conservation Areas carry his name.He died of natural causes in 1995 at the age of 91. He truly lived in harmony with nature.“As years go on and the population increases, there will be a need of these lands and more, and in life where so much appears futile, this one thing will remain. In essence, those who continue to support the work of conservation can say, I have lived here, I have done something positive to ensure that its natural beauty and natural values continue.”A Toronto French school and a conservation reserve trail are named after him.Hear him talk:Charles Sauriol in front of the original cottage at the Forks, July 1935.

11,"Mohawk Physician, Victorian Businessman and Philanthropist","Oronhyatekha, M.D.  1841 - 1907","Dr. Oronhyatekha was a remarkable Canadian who was successful as a Mohawk physician, scholar, and Victorian businessman.Born on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ontario, Oronhyatekha (means “Burning Sky”) was also known by his baptized name of Peter Martin. He attended colleges in Massachusetts and Ohio, before returning to teach at Tyendinaga on the Bay of Quinte.In 1860, Oronhyatekha, on behalf of the Six Nations, gave the welcoming address to the Edward, the Prince of Wales (future Edward VII). He so impressed the Royal Party that he was invited to study in England, resulting in his becoming the first North American of indigenous descent to attend Oxford University. Oronhyatekha’s portrait still hangs in St. Edmunds Hall at Oxford.In 1863 he returned to Canada and married a great-granddaughter of Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea), the great Mohawk chief and Loyalist military leader during the American War of Independence. While attending the University of Toronto, Oronhyatekha joined its militia corps, as well as the Queen’s Own Rifles; he also joined the Masonic order. In 1866 he graduated from the University of Toronto’s medical school, and was likely the first native medical doctor in Canada. He practiced medicine in Frankford, on the Trent River, and in Stratford, Napanee, and London, Ontario.In 1871 Oronhyatekha was part of the first Canadian rifle team invited to compete at Wimbledon, where he won nine prizes.He became President of the Grand Indian Council in 1874, an association of reserves in Quebec and Ontario, and often lobbied for change in legislation to give support to the native peoples in Canada.In 1878 he joined the Independent Order of Foresters (IOF) which was a fraternal life insurance company, and he became the first elected Supreme Chief Ranger of that organization in 1881. He was CEO for twenty-six years. He guided the IOF’s growth from a struggling bankrupt fraternal organization of 400 members to a membership of more than 250,000, and a fund of over eleven million dollars. Dr. Oronhyatekha wrote The History of the Independent Order of Foresters.Bay Street, looking north from Temperance Street (1907). We can see the IOF Temple Building (large building on the left) just one block down from Old City Hall. Toronto Archives, Fonds 1244, Item 7142In 1895 started the construction at Bay and Richmond streets of what was to become one of Toronto’s first iconic buildings: the Temple Building (the new IOF headquarters) by architect George W. Gouinlock.  Its opening in 1897 was marked with a parade and a banquet. A life-size sculpture of Oronhyatekha by Walter Seymour Allward was installed in the lobby.  The Temple had been built to last forever but was demolished in 1970 to make way for the Queen-Bay Centre.Oronhyatekha travelled the world extensively, and when he travelled, he collected artifacts. His collection included Australian boomerangs, Indo-Persian battle-axes, Burmese drums, Japanese shoes, and native artifacts, including a silver belt medal and compass owned by Tecumseh, an ally of General Brock. In his collection, as well, were over a thousand specimens of marine shells and coral. In 1911, part of his collection was donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.Oronhyatekha had organized the details of his funeral. His body lay in state at Massey Music Hall in Toronto, and in a four-hour period on March 6th, 1907, over ten thousand people paid their respects. That evening a memorial service was conducted at St. Peter’s Anglican Church, which he had attended. His body was later transported in a specially-commissioned train to Tyendinaga Reserve for a family service at Christ Church and interment there.As one of the greatest builders of the fraternal movement in North America, Dr. Oronhyatekha was widely accepted as a distinguished leader in Canada. His success in Victorian society was founded on the Mohawk values in which he believed, including the principle of reciprocity between people and the institutions they create. While inhabiting two worlds, he remained true to his Mohawk principles, heritage and language.Photo courtesy of the Woodland Cultural CentreHear him talk:","211 Carlton St, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/oronhyatekha-m-d/

She had been murdered.Deputy police chief Jim Noble’s (1924-2003) obituary gives us interesting insights in the arrest in Dr. Hume’s case (Noble was the officer who arrested the murderer):“in one of many infamous cases that he handled, Noble solved the murder of an 89-year-old female doctor, Rowena Hume, who was viciously beaten to death by a Salvation Army derelict whom she had hired to do a few odd jobs. Two days after the murder, having followed a series of clues, Noble nabbed the suspect on a downtown street; the man blurted out a confession almost instantly.”But beyond the sad story of her death, Dr. Hume’s memory conjures up the image of a great Cabbagetowner: a caring person, a humanist, and a pioneer.Hear her talk:","226 Carlton Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/rowena-hume/
13,A Pioneer for Women’s Rights Who Made Laura Secord a Household Name,Sarah Anne Curzon  1833 - 1898,"Sarah Anne Curzon lived at 274 Carlton Street between 1873 and 1875. She was a playwright, poet, journalist, and a pioneer in educating readers of her newspaper and magazine columns in which she wrote about female suffrage, property rights equal to men and access to higher education for women.Canadian history was the main source of her writing. Furthermore, she wanted to prove that women could write professionally in a field that at the time in Canada was dominated by men.Although she moved easily among fiction, poetry and history, she felt that the moral lessons of Canadian history could be taught in novels and poetry.While living in Cabbagetown, she wrote the play, The Sweet Girl Graduate, which mocked the idea that women were not intelligent enough to study at the university level.Sarah supported Dr. Emily Stowe’s efforts to found the Women’s Medical College on Sumach Street, which opened in 1883. The two women also founded the Toronto Women’s Literacy Club, which focused on advancing women’s rights, as well as literacy.Laura Secord on her Journey to Warn the British, [ca. 1921] by C. W.

He worked as a bricklayer until he came to Canada. He and his wife Anna Marie Ingleson, had five children, and in 1875 they moved into 314 Carlton Street, a Second-Empire style cottage that he had built.Shortly after they moved in, Mrs. Brick died, and in 1887 he married Margaret Leggott from Alliston, Ontario.At this time Mr. Brick was a prominent house-builder and chief contractor for the gas works site on Eastern Avenue.While on a trip to Paris, France, he was inspired by the workmanship and artistic forms that he saw in the houses that he visited.After his return to Toronto, he became well known for his richly–decorated plaster moldings and elaborate ceilings.In 1890 he moved his family into a new house he built a few doors away at 308 Carlton Street.

16,"Broadcaster, Playwright, Renaissance Man",Lister Sinclair  1921 - 2006,"Lister Sinclair was born in Bombay, India to Scottish parents. Oddly enough at 18 months old he was sent to live with an aunt in London, England and didn’t see his parents again until he was seven. He makes reference to serving a long sentence at an English boarding school. Lister was gifted at mathematics and won a scholarship to St. Paul’s School in London.While visiting North America with his mother in 1939 World War II broke out. Mr. Sinclair was not fit for military service due to a back injury as a teenager. Unable to return to the continent they stayed on with friends in Vancouver.While at the University of British Columbia, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and physics. In 1942, he moved to Toronto and continued his studies at the University of Toronto and also lectured in mathematics to undergraduates.His career was most memorable. He joined the CBC in 1944 and retired in 1999. Fifty five years is a long career and he was indeed one of Canada’s most prolific broadcasters.He wrote over 650 radio and television plays during his career. In 1949, he wrote Hilda Morgan, which was controversial as it featured a pregnant unmarried woman considering an abortion.His major contributions were to the programs that focused on the curious and diverse subjects like “Ideas“, “Man at the Centre”, and “The Nature of Things“.Bernie Lucht, longtime friend and executive producer of Ideas best described Lister as mischievious, brilliant, a compassionate genius with an expertise in everything from poetry, to mathematics, to music, to literature, and to culture. “He was simply a remarkable man.”A truly elegant man who did elegant work.In 1985 Lister Sinclair was made an officer of the Order of Canada.***Photo from www.gloriasaarinen.comOn November 4, 2014, the Cabbagetown People team met with Gloria Saarinen, long-time partner of Lister Sinclair. Ms. Saarinen shared with us memories of her life with Lister Sinclair.Gloria Saarinen is an internationally-acclaimed concert pianist and teacher. She worked with the great orchestras and conductors of the world, including Sir Ernest MacMillan.The transcription of this interview has been shortened and slightly edited.Memories of Lister Sinclair as told by Gloria Saarinen“When he was a baby just after he was weaned, his parents went to India. The father had a job there and they left him with his mother’s sister in London who, according to Lister, hated kids. She didn’t want him. So he never saw his parents. They’d write to him. I think he was seven before he saw his parents again. But the sister needed money and she was being paid. So she put him in boarding school at St Paul’s Boarding School, which is in London. And I know three people who all went to St. Paul’s School. And all hated it.“He ended up in Vancouver and he met all sorts of people at the university. There was Jon Drainie and Barry Moss and Pierre Berton. A whole host of people (and) all of them ended up coming to Toronto. And then Lister wrote that play We all Hate Toronto, which is quite fun.“Lister was fearless when it came to discussions, talking, words, ideals. I’ve never met anyone who was quite as fearless as he was. But then under duress when he’s attacked, he’s powerless. He doesn’t know what to do. He won’t stand up for himself. So that’s just who he was.“He was reading all the time. And I used to watch him. He’d stand on one leg, with the other one crooked behind the other one. Just standing there reading, anywhere. He was funny. He was always dry, humourous. And other times he quoted poetry. He talked about all sorts of things. Whether it was talking about just water or whatever it happened to be. It was fascinating.“And we travelled South America, San Jose and all kinds of places. And went on cloud forest walks. And saw butterflies and strange, unbelievable things. And saw wonderful architecture that he knew everything about.“During the time when we were in Cabbagetown, we always liked wandering around. And pottering in the shops because you never know what you’re going to find.“Lister was very Scottish in terms of loving Robbie Burns. He wouldn’t call him Robbie. He said, ‘He never got called that. It was Rob Burns. Nobody called him Robbie.’ So that’s what he said. And (he) knew the Burns tartan. And Lister has got his own tartan. And he was very, very strong on ‘You don’t wear tartans if you’re not a Wallace or a Stuart or whatever it is. You should be wearing the right tartan’.”","31 Hillcrest Park, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/lister-sinclair/
17,1927 Flyweight Boxing Champion of the World,Albert (Frenchy) Bélanger  1906 - 1969,"Albert (Frenchy) Bélanger, the son of Adolphe and Louise Bélanger was born in Toronto. He was the second eldest of seven children. All the children in the family had nicknames and Albert’s was “Bear.” The family originally lived on Sackville Street.Being one of the toughest boys to come out of Cabbagetown, he was simply known as “The Champ.” Because of his professional boxing skills he became a sports icon in the Roaring 20s. On December 19, 1927, at the young age of 21, he won the National Boxing Association’s World Flyweight title at Toronto’s CNE Coliseum, beating England’s Ernie Jarvis. Albert won the title by a decision and he became the toast of Hogtown. The day after the fight, newspapers described it as an epic battle. The match drew 9,500 people, including many politicians and businessmen. Frenchy retired in 1930 after 61 bouts, which include 13 knockouts, 24 decisions, seven draws, and 17 losses. He also won the Canadian title and defended it several times.In the same year he married Ivy Bertha Bracewell, and they had two children. They lived on Winchester Street, and at the same time Frenchy worked as a waiter/bouncer at the Winchester Hotel on Parliament Street.Frenchy was known as a kind, funny and loving father. He was a “real gentleman,” and a role model for the many children with whom he came in contact. He started a boxing club at a church and it was discovered only by accident that he was a world champion boxer. Such was his humility. On any night of the week, Frenchy could draw 10,000 fans into the coliseum to watch him fight. He fought at a time that boxing historians refer to as the “Golden Age of Flyweights.”Hear him talk:","2 Lancaster Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/albert-frenchy-belanger/

20,Canadian Figure Skater and Artist,Toller Cranston  1949 - 2015,"(Plaque to be installed in 2017 at 3 Metcalfe Street)Legendary figure skater Toller Cranston was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He spent his young years in Kirkland Lake and, at the age of 11, his family moved to Montréal.At the age of seven, his parents bought him hockey skates. He, in turn, tried to dance on the ice. And so began his love of figure skating. He met Eva Vasak when he was 11 and she coached him for eight years.In 1968, he met Ellen Burka, a renowned skating coach. She invited him to stay in her home for seven days; he ended up staying for seven years. Toller, a clockwise spinner and jumper, brought new artistry to the sport. In no time, he became known for his creative free-skating style, dazzling crowds while accumulating medals.During competitions and championships, it was very clear that Toller was an original: radical in his approach to skating and unlike anything that the public had ever seen. Millions were glued to their televisions to watch his spectacular flamboyant performances.It has been said that the face of men’s figure skating was changed by Toller Cranston and Ellen Burka. Cranston became one of the most sought after choreographers. He inspired future generations of champion skaters who became “tollerized” by wanting to imitate his style.After the 1976 competitive season, Cranston, who always wanted to develop “theatre on ice,” performed and starred in the Broadway show The Ice Show. He then went on to tour Europe with Holiday on Ice.Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, he made a series of skating specials for CBC television. In 1997, he left the skating world to work exclusively on painting and art.Although we know him as a skater, all the while he was also an accomplished painter. Toller’s interest in art began at an early age. His mother was a painter and he too always wanted to paint. He went to the École des beaux-arts de Montréal and, by his third year, it was suggested that the school had little more to teach him. At this point, he turned his attention to becoming a professional artist.Credit: Ottawa CitizenAfter selling his Cabbagetown home in Toronto in the early 1990s, he bought a home in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico where his main focus became painting. In an interview, he said that San Miguel seduced him. He loved the fact that it was so cosmopolitan. He became very involved in the well-being of the local community and a most generous philanthropist.Toller Cranston died in his beloved San Miguel in 2015 at the age of 65.Many paintings, drawings, and objets d’art from the Toller Cranston Estate Collection are being made available through the Artworld Fine Art Gallery in Toronto.Cranston lived a unique yet complex cutting-edge life. He was a colourful character, known for his sense of humour, his energetic manner and his enormous generosity. In 2003, the Globe and Mail wrote that he was “his own work of art.” Critics have said that he will be remembered as larger than life, the figure skating champion who revolutionized the sport and brought colour and panache to the world.Click HERE to see Toller Cranston Remembered – Video Presentation for Memorial (2015)Awards and Honours1976 Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame

21,One of Canada’s Greatest Artists and Teachers,Frederick Hagan  1918 - 2003,"When Frederick Hagan was 13 years old, his father, a cabinet maker, died. His mother was left to raise eight children, so at the age of 16, he dropped out of school to work in a paper-box factory.From a studio he set up in an empty garage, he used to wander the streets of his Cabbagetown neighbourhood sketching and painting.While studying at the Ontario College of Art (now Ontario College of Art and Design) his teachers were John Alfsen, who became a mentor and father figure, and Frank Carmichael of the Group of Seven.In 1946 Mr. Hagan was hired to teach drawing, painting and printmaking at O.C.A. He was living in Newmarket at the time and commuted to Toronto for the next 37 years.Like most painters, his work was deeply-rooted in his own experiences, and it was never easy to classify. His work never lost its figurative basis. He had a different way of seeing the world.Mr. Hagan left a great legacy as a teacher at O.C.A. He challenged his students and gave them an immense technical background, along with invitations to great parties at his home.In 1985 Canada Post commissioned him to create a set of 16 postage stamps on the theme of Canadian explorers.Stamps by Frederick HaganIn 1998, he was awarded the Royal Canadian Academy of Art’s medal.

22,Author and Witness to Depression-Era Cabbagetown,Hugh Garner  1913 - 1979,"In 1919, when he was six years old, Hugh Garner’s parents emigrated to Canada from Yorkshire, England. He grew up in Cabbagetown and began working at the Toronto Star as a copy boy. Eventually, he realized that in order to succeed as a writer, he had to work at the task full time, so he quit his day job.During the Depression he “rode the rails” across Canada and the United States, working at a number of different jobs. He also fought in the Spanish Civil War. When World War II broke out, he joined the Navy and served on Atlantic convoy duty until 1945.As a Canadian writer Hugh Garner’s poor, urban, Protestant background is evident in his work. His focus was on working-class Ontario. The best known of his realistic novels is Cabbagetown (1950). His extensive literary output includes 100 short stories, 17 books, numerous articles, radio and T.V. scripts, and his autobiography, One Damn Thing After Another. In 1963, Hugh Garner was awarded the Goveror General’s Literary Award for Hugh Garner’s Best Stories, A Collection of His Short Stories.Hugh Garner is known for his hard-living lifestyle, which he lived to the end.The Hugh Garner Housing Co-operative on Ontario Street is named after him.Hear him talk:","550 Ontario Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/hugh-garner/
23,First Conductor of The Toronto Symphony Orchestra,Luigi von Kunits  1871 - 1931,"Luigi von Kunits was born and raised in the musically-enriched city of Vienna, Austria. He studied violin, composition and music history with some of the finest teachers.When Luigi von Kunits was eleven years old, the great Brahms himself asked him to play second violin in one of the composer’s string quartets. When he was twenty-one, he had the opportunity to perform his own violin concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.In 1893, he traveled to the United States to perform with an Austrian orchestra at the Chicago World’s Fair, where he also won the best solo violinist trophy. At this time, he decided to stay in the United States and taught violin in Chicago from 1893 until 1896. Subsequently, he taught at the Pittsburgh Conservatory from 1896 until 1910 and was also concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.In 1912 he came to Canada and the Canadian Academy of Music in Toronto offered him a position as head violin teacher.In September of 1922, two young men visited Luigi von Kunits in his studio. The proposition Louis Gesensway and Abe Fenboque presented was to found a new symphony orchestra. They had no money or connections and spoke only for themselves and some fine musicians, most of whom were his students. These musicians had a great desire to make better music than they were playing at the vaudeville houses or the “new” movie-houses. They wanted Luigi von Kunits because they knew he could train an orchestra comprised of his students, and that he would be inspired by the challenge of building a new orchestra.On April 23, 1923, at 5:00 pm, the New Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Luigi von Kunits, made its debut in Massey Hall. There were about 60 musicians and admission was 75, 50 and 25 cents, no seats reserved. The response was very good and the critics were most impressed.Mrs. von Kunits initiated the Toronto Symphony Orchestra Women’s Committee. This strong group of women found ways to financially support and sustain the orchestra, and by the fifth season the orchestra had found its place and its patrons. The New Symphony became the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. For the next five years Luigi von Kunits (now an honorary Doctor of Music from the University of Toronto) brought a series of Twilight Concerts to Toronto, which gave purpose and pleasure to its musicians and a great deal of pleasure to its citizens.The 1924 – 25 season included the first orchestra sponsored jointly by the Toronto Board of Education and the Toronto Catholic School Board. This concert was the beginning of the TSO Education Program.In the Fall of 1929, the first radio broadcast was heard across Canada on CNR Radio Network. This performance was broadcast from the Arcadian Court, a large dining area in Simpson’s Department Store in downtown Toronto. The concerts took place on Sundays, which was convenient for the musicians. The venue for broadcasts eventually moved to the studios of CFRB Radio.Maestro von Kunits, with his proper conductor’s mane of hair, always accepted admiration and applause with great style. His life was music. He was devoted to establishing a solid foundation for his orchestra. It has been said that he brought German music to this new land and transmitted it through a mind that was essentially Greek. He acknowledged his doctorate in Latin, yet he was known to keep notes about his students in Greek.When Luigi von Kunits died in 1931, the members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra mourned the loss of their great conductor. For nine years they had played for him, admired him as an artist and loved him as a man.Hear him talk:","675 Ontario Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/luigi-von-kunits/
24,"Political Cartoonist, Global Literacy  Advocate, Humanitarian",Ben Wicks  1926 - 2000,"Ben Wicks was an acclaimed cartoonist with an incredible sense of humour. He was born in London, England in 1926, the son of a poor, working class Cockney family. During wartime the family evacuated to the country. When Ben was 14 years of age they returned to the city and at that time he left school, and he got his first job as a shipping clerk. “I was bloody hopeless at school,” he recalled. “Left at 14 and they were pleased to see me go as I was.”He took evening classes at an art school. “They told me I should take up something else, so I quit. “They were right, I still can’t draw,” he said, years after becoming a highly successful cartoonist.He did learn to play the saxophone in the British Army and toured Europe with a band.In 1957 with just twenty five dollars in his pocket, he and his wife Doreen emigrated to Canada. While in Calgary, he worked as a milkman and then joined the Canadian Army as a musician. It was at this time that he began studying cartooning for books. His first major success was being published by the Saturday Evening Post.In 1963, he visited Toronto and met feature cartoonist Norman Drew who advised him to move to Toronto. Before long he began work at the Toronto Telegram and his cartoon “The Outcasts” was soon syndicated in over 50 newspapers. In 1971 when the Telegram was no longer in operation, his cartoons were picked up by the Toronto Star. Now called “Wicks,” it was carried by 84 Canadian and more than 100 American newspapers.“Ben Wicks’ cartoons provide important insights on 20th century events and Canadian culture. His work features keen insights into the human condition and a sense of humour that add depth and texture to our understanding of historical events, particularly during the Trudeau era. The cartoons will be particularly useful for research into Canadian studies, political science and communications, says Michael Moir, University archivist and Head of the Clara Thomas Archives & Special Collections.“I had admired the single-panel Ben Wicks cartoons for years”, his friend and standup comic Dave Broadfoot said. “Those cartoons worked like what is called a “blackout’ on stage – a comic idea that lasts 30 seconds with one strong, self-explanatory punch line. Not easy to do. That’s what Ben’s cartoons were: funny, political and brief.”In 1980, he opened a restaurant on Parliament Street in Cabbagetown called The Ben Wicks. He sold it just three years later, after losing his shirt. He was apparently a clever creative man but a very poor administrator. The restaurant kept his name for a while, then became The Local Gest. It is now called The Tilted Dog.Ben Wicks was also a TV personality and on his own show, The World of Wicks, he interviewed personalities such as Michael Caine, Ingrid Bergman and Sir Edmund Hilary.He also wrote and illustrated books, and established the I.Can Foundation, which provided education and literacy programs, such as Born to Read, for children.Hear him talk:","424 Parliament Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/ben-wicks/

27,Poet,Al Purdy  1918 - 2000,"Al Purdy has been called “the most Canadian poet”, as well as the best English-language Canadian poet of the century. He wrote 33 books of verse, and twice won Canada’s Governor General’s Literary Award, once in 1966 for his collection, The Cariboo Horses, and again in 1986 for his Collected Poems, 1956 – 1996. He also received the Order of Canada. These awards are among the highest honours an artist can receive in Canada.As a young man living on Sackville Street, he loved observing the residents of Cabbagetown, and spending time at the Riverdale Zoo. His voice was that of the common man and woman; he gave ordinary events an extraordinary view.He was not a poet-academic like so many of his peers. His first book was self-published. A high school dropout, he served an “undistinguished” term in the air force. His final work is a 652 page collection of poems entitled Beyond Remembering.Al Purdy died at his home in Victoria, B.C. from lung cancer at the age of 81.From Al Purdy’s book, Naked with Summer in Your Mouth:Ages

Ever born on earth
– life bursts into flame
for me the night stars shine
for me it’s always June
days are bright discoveries
in my infinite bedroom world
the moon’s a silver spoonI am very young
only 16
I will never die
the years are made
of edible gold braid
the weeks are sun sun
and endless endless
the days stand still
I am 25 now
and feel the same
only more so
the world’s a lovely place
full of birds’ cries
and all my own
the birds like little jewels
belong to meI am 32
and know a lady here
on this lovely earth
each day she steps out of
the sunrise glow
emerging like a star
I walk my life with her
I am 40 now
and knowing less and less
each day I live
bewildered by the loss
of gifts existence gives
still foolish but finally
I’ve learned how
to curse what I can’t blessNow I grumble aloud

28,Nobel Laureate – Physics 1981,Dr. Arthur Schawlow  1921 - 1999,"Another plaque is also affixed to the west side of the Winchester Public School that Schawlow once attended.Born in Mount Vernon, New York, Arthur, at the age of three years old, moved to Toronto with his family to the neighbourhood of Cabbagetown, later attending Winchester Public School. “Bud”, as he was called, was a nice young boy. He was not athletic, he read a lot, was smart in school, and skipped some grades. After some difficulty in a regular classroom, his mother took him for an IQ test. His score was extremely high. He was then transferred to the Model School at Church and Gould Streets (now Ryerson University) where Toronto’s “gifted” children went in the 1930s. Arthur also excelled in Boy Scouts, reaching the highest rank – King’s Scout.As a youngster, he read everything he could find on, things scientific, electrical, mechanical or astronomical. His intent was to study radio engineering, but at that point in the 1930’s, the economic depression was at its height. Very few families could afford to send their children to university, and there were no scholarships in engineering. His sister, Rosemary, scored excellent marks in Grade 13, but didn’t get a scholarship to the University of Toronto, so she voluntarily repeated the year in order to earn marks high enough to win the $125 tuition to Victoria College to study English literature. In 1937, at the age of sixteen, Arthur joined his sister there. His scholarship was for mathematics and physics, and it was physics that he pursued, earning a Ph.D from the University in 1949. While at University, Arthur was very involved in the Toronto amateur jazz scene and played clarinet with a group called the Delta Jazz Band. Listening to traditional jazz from his large record collection continued to stimulate and interest him throughout his life.While on a postdoctoral fellowship to Columbia University, he met Charles H. Townes, a leader in research on microwave spectroscopy, and their long collaboration began. In 1951, he married Aurelia, Charles Townes’ youngest sister.Over the ten years that followed, Arthur Schawlow worked as a physicist at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and with his brother-in-law in his spare time. They co-authored a book, published in 1955, entitled Microwave Spectroscopy, and continued to work together on the principles of a device – the Laser.Arthur Schawlow then went on to become a professor of physics at Stanford University, and was chairman of the department of physics from 1966 to 1970. In 1981 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his contribution to the development of laser spectroscopy. Dr. Schawlow retired from teaching and became Professor Emeritus in 1991.Honours and Awards:Hear him talk:","436 Sackville Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/arthur-schawlow/
29,Canada’s Pre-eminent World War II Artist,Jack Nichols  1921 - 2009,"Jack Nichols, from deckhand to painter, printmaker, draftsman, and educatorHe lived among us, unnoticed and uncelebrated. Some who knew him even called him mysterious. But you may have come across him on walks through the Cabbagetown neighbourhood without knowing it.But, in art circles, he was well known. His work appears in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian War Museum and in many private collections.Born in Montreal, and as many artists, he was largely self- taught. In his early years in Montreal, he worked with Fredrick Varley and Louis Muhlstock.During the summer in the early 1940’s, he worked as a deckhand on cargo boats plying the Great Lakes.Word War II drew him to enlist in the Merchant Navy in 1943. Shortly thereafter, the National Gallery of Canada, realizing his talent, commissioned him to produce drawings of shipboard life.Jack Nichols’ big break came when the Royal Canadian Reserve appointed him “official war artist,” and this gave him the rank of Lieutenant, and put him to work on a number of Canadian warships.He witnessed the D-Day landing, the destruction of a German warship convoy and other horrific acts of war.Out of this came some of his best known works; Men on the H.M.C.S., Iroquois, Actions on His Majesty’s Canadian Ship, Drowning Sailor, Taking Survivors on Board, and many others. These artistic depictions of Canadian bravery in battle did not go unnoticed.In 1947 he was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, which, at last, gave him the means to formally study fine lithography, printmaking and to paint in the United States.In 1948 Jack Nichols went on to teach at the Vancouver School of Art. Shortly thereafter he went on to be a prizewinner at the Second International Exhibition of Drawing and Engraving in Lugano, Switzerland, and then on to display at the Venice Biennale. He has had exhibitions at the Ellen Gallery and the McCord Museum in Montreal, the MacKenzie Gallery in Saskatchewan, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Canadian War Records Collection in Ottawa and in Canada’s most prestigious venue, the Canadian War Museum, etc.His friends talk of his intensity and his charm. They have described Jack Nichols as prodigiously talented, a painter who Goya himself might have envied.Jack Nichols never advertised his accomplishments. He just walked the streets of Cabbagetown unnoticed in his own mysterious way.John Fillion, a contemporary Canadian sculptor says of him, “he’s the finest draftsman in Canada.”The Ingram Gallery invites you to share your memories of Jack Nichols. We live on in the memories of others. As such, visit often, spend time with Nichols’ works and publications, and delight in the legacy of a great Canadian artist and neighbourhood friend.Cabbagetowner Gina Dineen (founder of the Cabbagetown Short Film & Video Festival) also did a short documentary on her friend Jack Nichols and his work.  It’s entitled Mystery & Light and can be seen on YouTube.Photos courtesy of the Ingram Gallery","395a Sackville Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/jack-nichols/
30,Czech-Canadian Literary Giant,Josef Škvorecký  1924 - 2012,"Josef Škvorecký was a very human hero who loved the freedom he had as a writer in Canada.Born in Nachod, Czechoslovakia, Mr. Škvorecký was educated at a local school and was intent on learning English because he was a great fan of the American singer/actor, Judy Garland.During the 1950’s he worked as an editor, translator and teacher.He attended Charles University in Prague and in 1952 completed a Phd in philosophy. While working for a government publishing company, he translated the works of Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and Raymond Chandler from English to Czech.At this time he wrote several novels including his first novel The Cowards and The End of the Nylon Age. They were banned after publication but have now been translated into 20 languages.Although he loved his homeland, after the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, Mr. Škvorecký and his actress/novelist wife Zdena Salivarova came to Toronto.He began working as a writer- in-residence at the University of Toronto, and then in 1971 he taught literature and film until 1990. He also wrote for television and radio, and wrote screenplays for film.Also in 1971 he and his wife founded a publishing company called 68 Publishers which published banned Czech and Slovak books. These books, written by such people as Vaclav Havel, Ludvik Vaculik and Milan Kundera, were smuggled into communist Eastern Europe. For providing this critical literary outlet, the president of post-communist Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, later awarded the couple the Order of the White Lion in 1990 during their first visit back to Czechoslovakia.Josef Škvorecký was a brilliant storyteller who wrote more than 40 books. In Canada, he is considered to be a Canadian author despite the fact that he wrote mostly in Czech.“I am a Czech and I am a loyal citizen of Canada,” he told an interviewer in 2006.“Canada is the country where, for the first time in my adult life, I found freedom, including the freedom to be a Czech and at the same time a Canadian.”The miracle of jazz, the expatriate experience, repression and the horrors of totalitarianism are the themes of his fictitious novels.He once declared: “To me literature is forever blowing a horn, singing about youth when youth is irretrievably gone, singing about your homeland when, in the schizophrenia of the times, you find yourself in a land that lies over the ocean, a land – no matter how hospitable and friendly – where your heart is not, because you landed on those shores too late.” He and his wife visited their homeland often, but never wished to return permanently.In a most humble way he thanked Canada for his freedom. “There is beauty everywhere on earth, but there is more beauty in those places where one feels that sense of ease which comes from no longer having to put off one’s dreams.”He is buried in Cabbagetown’s Necropolis, just beside the chapel.Awards and Honours","487 Sackville Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/josef-skvorecky/
31,Prolific Early Toronto Designer and Architect,Eden  Smith  1858 - 1949,"Eden Smith was born in Birmingham, England. He was one of the youngest of a large Victorian family.He studied drawing and architecture throughout Europe. He and his wife Annie moved to Toronto in 1888 and he began his architectural practice in 1892. In 1890 they lived at 34 Salisbury Avenue.Much of his early work in Toronto was ecclesiastical and sponsored by the Anglican Church. He designed several churches, among them the church of St. Cyprian in Seaton village, St. John the Evangelist on Portland Street and the church of St. Thomas on Huron Street.After 1888, domestic architecture monopolized his prolific output. He designed 11 houses in Wychwood Park and others in Rosedale, The Annex and Forest Hill, many of which embodied the contemporary design principles found in the Arts and Crafts Movement, of which Smith was a leading exponent. His style was called English Cottage, which had steep-pitched roofs, tall chimneys, and bands of small-paned casement windows.In his 33 years of practice he designed over 2,500 houses in the city. He was also on-site and supervised the construction.Another outstanding achievement was the design of the co-op housing complex at the corner of Spruce and Sumach Streets in Cabbagetown. It was begun in 1913 and flourishes to this day as a model of successful co-operative housing.Mr. Smith was also one of the founding members of the Arts and Letters Club.Eden Smith died on October 10, 1949, and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Guelph, Ontario.Hear him talk:Spruce Court Co-op (at Spruce and Sumach) designed by Eden Smith","34 Salisbury Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/eden-smith/

33,Heavyweight Boxer Champion of the Dominion of Canada and the British Empire,"Lawrence Samuel ""Larry"" Gains  1900 - 1983","He could have been a contender for World Champion?Lawrence Samuel “Larry” Gains was born on Sumach Street in the Cabbagetown area of Toronto. As a young twenty year old he boxed out of Toronto’s Praestamus Athletic Club, an organization for Black boxers. His amateur career was highly successful and in 1923 he went to England to pursue a professional career.He was considered an excellent heavyweight at a time when there were many good heavyweight boxers. It has been written that he took London by storm. Before long he was the Canadian Heavyweight Champion.The new fistic idol of Europe won every major title and knocked out heavyweight champion Max Schmeling. The historians now announce that he scored a two-round knockout over Max Schmeling. This would have made Larry Gains champion of the world by historic proxy.Due to the times, he was not allowed to fight for the British Championship and the World Champion. There was a bar on black boxers and they could only compete for the “Coloured Heavyweight Champion of the World”, which he won in 1928 and 1935.“For me, the world title was always the impossible dream, the unreachable star”, Gains said shortly before his death. “The politics of the day was against it. But I have no bitterness or regrets”.In 1974 Larry Gains was inducted into the Canadian Boxing Hall of Fame.Hear him talk:","404 Shuter St, Toronto, ON M5A 1X6, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/larry-gains/
34,"Writer, Novelist, Broadcaster",Morley Callaghan  1903 - 1990,"Morley Callaghan was born into an Irish Catholic family, and lived the first five years of his life in Belshaw Place in Cabbagetown. He was educated at the University of Toronto, and attended Osgoode Hall in 1925, but never practiced law.He worked as a junior reporter at the Toronto Star, where he met Gordon Sinclair and the older Ernest Hemingway, who encouraged him to be a writer. His first novel, Strange Fugitive, was published in 1928. He was thought of as Canada’s first “urban novelist”.In the 1950s he focused on broadcasting, and became a public personality. At this time he was doing little writing. American critic, Edmond Wilson identified him as an “unjustly neglected writer”, and compared him to Checkov and Turgenev. This pronouncement in 1960 led to many reprints of Callaghan’s works in Europe and Asia, where his concern for “the little man” attracted popularity.One of the finest memoirs in Canadian literature was his book entitled That Summer in Paris (1963), reminiscences of his memorable stay there in 1929. In Paris, he matured as a writer, and developed friendships with some of the most famous authors of the century, including Hemingway and Joyce.Mr. Callaghan received the 1951 Governor General’s Award for his book, The Loved and the Lost. He was the recipient of numerous awards, prizes, honours and the Royal Bank Award.

35,"Soldier, Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry, Killed in Afghanistan",Corporal Ainsworth Dyer  1977 - 2002,"Corporal Dyer, the son of the late Paul and Agatha Dyer, was born in Montréal, Quebec. He grew up in Regent Park, a downtown neighbourhood in Toronto. Raised by his strict Jamaican grandmother, he had a strong sense of right and wrong.In February 1996, Ainsworth Dyer enrolled with the Militias 48th Highlanders of Canada as an infantryman. In October 1997, he transferred to the Regular Force. When completing battle-school he became a member of the Edmonton-based battalion of the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry. After joining the 5 Platoon in 1998, he quickly developed into a mature and responsible soldier. He served as a Rifleman and was deployed on Operation Palladium to Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2000.Always looking to challenge himself, Ainsworth trained for the “Mountain Man” competition, the blood and guts of the light infantry soldier. He also conquered the skies and became a paratrooper. His sense of adventure complemented his strong temperament.Corporal Dyer was one of four Canadians killed during a “friendly fire” incident in Afghanistan in 2002. Eight other soldiers from the Battalion were injured. This tragedy is referred to as The Tarnak Farm Incident. An American F-16 fighter jet piloted by an Air National Guard dropped a laser-guided bomb on the Canadians who were conducting a night firing exercise at Tarnak Farms. The deaths of these Canadian soldiers were Canada’s first during the war in Afghanistan and the first in a combat zone since the Korean War.Corporal Ainsworth Dyer was buried with full military honours in the Necropolis Cemetery in Cabbagetown. In a touching moment, his parents released a box of doves.
In February 2003, Corporal Dyer was commemorated on the Rakkasan Memorial Wall at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.The Ainsworth Dyer Bridge, a footbridge in Edmonton’s Rundle Park , has special meaning for both the Dyer and Von Sloten families. It was at this spot that Ainsworth proposed to his girlfriend Jocelyn Von Sloten before he left for Afghanistan. After Ainsworth was killed, Aart Von Sloten, Jocelyn’s father, began making wooden crosses for all the soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Each cross is inscribed with the name and rank of the 158 men and women who died while serving in the Canadian forces in Afghanistan. Over the years, a ceremony has been held on Remembrance Day and the names of those who have died are read aloud and a cross placed in the ground in their honour. The ceremony began with a small group but has grown to include many people who wish to pay their respects to these fallen soldiers.Ainsworth Dyer is described by his colleagues as a thoughtful leader, his own man, and one who had strength of heart that was unparalleled. He will be remembered as a brave soldier. In the words of retired Sgt. Oswald Reece, who trained Ainsworth as a young recruit, “he was a standout person; he was always ready to step up to the plate; he was the perfect soldier.”","402 Shuter Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/ainsworth-dyer/

40,Medical Pioneer and Champion of Early Learning,"Fraser Mustard, M.D.  1927 - 2011","Most doctors heal you when you are sick. Doctor Mustard could foretell your future.A most unconventional man!!Dr. Fraser Mustard, a Canadian physician and scientist, was born in Toronto, Ontario. He attended Whitney Public School and in 1953 he earned a medical degree from the University of Toronto. During his varsity football days he was known as “Moose”.In the 1950s and 60s his heart research focused on blood platelets, arterial disease and, believe it or not, the effects of Aspirin.In 1966 he criticized the Canadian government for their research funding practices. Many medical doctors graduating from Canadian universities were going to the United States due to the lack of research funding. As such, there was a need for many more doctors to graduate in order to maintain the standard of research and Canadian healthcare. It was at this time that he became a founding member of the McMaster University Faculty of Medicine in Hamilton, Ontario. This huge network, built at this time, linked researchers in social health, education, economics and high tech fields like robotics – a model that has been copied all over the world.Dr. Mustard’s interests shifted to early childhood education research where he influenced decision-makers all over the world. His early years’ studies report emphasized the promotion of early child development centres for young children and parents. He recommended that the government boost spending on early education and that programs should be available to all income levels in order to develop healthy, confident children and adults. His message was to convey the incredible importance of a child’s experiences in the first six years of life. Interventions in these early years can set-up a child for life. He said, “These years last a lifetime. The challenge for all societies is to close the gap between what we know about the determinants of early child development and what we do.”Fraser Mustard said, “That’s all education is. It’s just getting the architecture and the function of the brain set.”In 1982 he became the founding president of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) where he spent fourteen years doing research. In 1993 he was awarded the Royal Bank Outstanding Service to Canada award for setting up CIFAR, which is considered one of the best think-tanks and research centres in Canada.Dr. Fraser Mustard has left a legacy. About four months before his death, his followers came to his home to further discuss his works. While working in his living room, the Fraser Mustard Institute for Human Development was designed. The University of Toronto has officially launched the institute.“Fraser Mustard will be remembered as the great renaissance man of Canadian intellectual life. He was an absolute giant, who had a huge impact on his country, and a man of unflagging curiosity and great generosity of spirit”. (University of Toronto former President David Naylor).Dr. Mustard’s findings paved the way to create a province-wide full-day kindergarten program. He will always be remembered for his medical and educational achievements.AwardsA biography of his life written by Marian Packham, entitled J.

41,"Artist, Activist, Teacher",Bill Stapleton  1916 - 2008,"“He moved to Cabbagetown to join the human race.”Most of us who have ever walked or driven up Sumach Street, and glanced into that second floor window, maybe glimpsing an easel or part of some “work in progress,” would never know the passion and conviction of that man who moved to Cabbagetown to join the human race. Why Cabbagetown? Probably because of its then (and now) unique and diverse environment.That man was Bill Stapleton, artist, social activist, humanist, free thinker, teacher, decorated citizen, and, for a time, a member of the Communist Party.Some compared his work with the likes of Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec. In their tradition, Bill would hang out at the Winchester Hotel, the long-gone Paramount Tavern and Trojan Coffee House, and sketch the colourful and sometimes rowdy clientele – working-class people having a good time. One might categorize his work as “slice of life” art.Carol Moore-Ede, Stapleton’s friend and curator said of his technique, “[his style] had a relaxed structure but his lines were direct and bold, drawn with rock steady hand and a sharp eye. He painted in startlingly vibrant colours and bold strokes, as forthright in his technique as he was in his social convictions.”Over the years, driven by his artistic and social justice convictions, he travelled to the Soviet Union, Nicaragua, Mexico and Spain to document the human condition.He was associated with ArtHeart, the community-based initiative to assist and promote art and young artists, and a member of “Veterans Against Nuclear Arms.” In an effort to mobilize artists for world disarmament, he joined the movement “Arts for Peace,” where he worked alongside Margaret Lawrence, Pierre Berton, Norman Jewison, Margaret Atwood, and Karen Kain.Collections of Mr. Stapleton’s work are in the National Archives of Canada, and in the Canadian War Museum. In 2006, he donated 1,500 canvases and sketches to the Cabbagetown Regent Park Community Museum in Toronto.In 2007, at the golden age of 91, Mr. Stapleton was presented with the Ontario Federation of Labour’s “Lifetime Cultural Achievement” award for his artistic documentation of labour struggles both in Canada and around the world.So said Bill Stapleton, the man who moved to Cabbagetown to join the human race.","424 Sumach Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/bill-stapleton/
42,Historical Painter and Illustrator,Charles William Jefferys  1869 - 1951,"Called the “Owl House” because of the terracotta owl detail on the side of the house.Charles William Jefferys was a well-known painter, illustrator, muralist, writer and teacher. He was born in Rochester, England and arrived in Toronto, Ontario with his family around 1880. His formal training as an artist began in 1884 when he attended evening classes at the Ontario School of Art. After attending school, he apprenticed with the Toronto Lithography Company for five years.Beginning work as a newspaper illustrator and artist, he was with the Toronto Globe from 1889 to 1892 and then served as an illustrator for the New York Herald from 1893-1901. Returning to Toronto, he became a magazine and book illustrator.During World War I he was given an assignment overseas, but was unable to undertake the job. Subsequently, he was commissioned by the Canadian War Records department to paint soldiers who were training at Camp Petawawa and Niagara, Ontario.C.W. Jefferys was also an accomplished painter in the English manner. He produced compelling oils and wonderful watercolours. He especially loved the Saskatchewan prairies and painted at Last Mountain Lake and the Battlefords. His work was widely exhibited and collected. He inspired many artists and was instrumental in forming Canada’s most famous group of landscape painters, the Group of Seven.From 1912 to 1939 he taught painting and drawing in the Department of Architecture at the University of Toronto. He was also a lecturer and part-time instructor at the Ontario College of Art. After his retirement he continued to produce illustrations and murals.Mr. Jefferys and Ivor Lewis were among the group of artists who founded the Graphic Arts Club (later named the Canadian Society of Graphic Arts), which by the 1940’s became the primary artists’ group in Canada.Remembered primarily for his bold illustrations of Canadian history and as a well-known painter of military genre, he is one of the most frequently reproduced of Canadian illustrators, and is best known for his visual reconstructions of Canadian history.C.W. Jefferys was a strong advocate of artistic nationalism, an artist who explored both the nature of our landscape and the historical and pre-historical background that shaped Canadian society.

44,Canadian Opera Company Conductor and Visionary,Richard Bradshaw  1944 - 2007,"The driving force behind Canada’s first purpose-built opera house. On its opening night he received a standing ovation even before he picked up his baton.Richard Bradshaw was born in Rugby, England. Encouraged by his father, an amateur musician, he began piano lessons at age eight and by twelve he was organist in the local church; he played the flute with the National Youth Orchestra.In 1965, he graduated from the University of London. His conducting teacher was Sir Adrian Boult, and a scholarship allowed him to work with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Charles Groves. From 1975 to 1988, he worked as Chorus Director at the Glyndebourne Festival and then Chorus Director and Resident Conductor at San Francisco Opera before coming to the Canadian Opera Company as Chief Conductor. He was named Artistic Director in 1994 and General Director in 1998, attracting distinguished Canadian artists Robert Lepage and Atom Egoyan as collaborators, and working with authors Margaret Atwood and Robertson Davies to create new operas.“We are a great and rich country and getting richer, but we have third-world investment in the arts,” he said. With determination and resolve, helped by a supportive board and hundreds of others, he embarked on the campaign to build an opera house — he enjoyed describing it as the “Thirty Years’ War.”The architect Jack Diamond said, “Without him we wouldn’t have had an opera house. He was a visionary but had the energy and capability to get it done. He will be remembered as a builder — not just of the building — but of the company itself.” The COC’s recordings and tours earned the company widespread recognition and numerous awards.The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts opened to international acclaim in 2006. To launch its first season, Richard Bradshaw led the COC orchestra and chorus in performing Wagner’s epic The Ring of the Nibelung, becoming the first conductor since Wagner himself to open an opera house with a complete Ring Cycle.The opera house and the more than fifty opera productions he conducted in Toronto are only part of his legacy. To Andrew Porter, his friend and a world renowned music critic, he was “a practical visionary, an inspired champion with a high vision” for opera and the arts.AwardsPhoto: Michael CooperPhoto Fred Lum/ The Globe and Mail","397 Wellesley Street East, Toronto, ON, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/richard-bradshaw/

50,Remains of York/Toronto's Early Settlers Moved to the Necropolis,Early Settlers   -,"Potter’s Field was a six-acre plot in what is now the Yorkville district of Toronto, and was the first non-sectarian burying ground in the Town of York. People in the mid-nineteenth century didn’t want a cemetery in the middle of their village, believing that “germs and disease” came from cemeteries.The most common causes of death at that time were fever and childbirth. So, Potter’s Field was closed, and the remains of 984 of the 6,685 early settlers buried there were moved to their final resting place in the Necropolis. Some bodies were also moved to Mount Pleasant Cemetery. Only those bodies with head stones were moved.The Necropolis (Greek for City of the Dead) was situated on the west slope of the Don Valley between Winchester and Amelia Streets. Although Winchester Street was one of the main crossing points across the Don River, there were only a few houses in the area and a hotel (the infamous Donvale House) located part way down the hill towards the bridge connecting Cabbagetown to, what is now, Riverdale.Between 1851 and 1881 the remains of these early settlers were re-interred in a section of the cemetery designated, “The Resting Place of Pioneers”.Plaque on the side of high-rise at Bloor and Yonge Street","200 Winchester Street, Toronto, ON M4X 1B8, Canada",http://www.cabbagetownpeople.ca/person/early-settlers/
