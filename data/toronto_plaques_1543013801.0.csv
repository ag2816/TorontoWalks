0,43.663153,-79.327211,Alexander Muir 1830-1906,"A maple tree on the southwest corner of Laing Street and Memory Lane, a block south of Queen Street, is reputed to be the tree that inspired Alexander Muir to compose the song ""The Maple Leaf Forever"" in 1867. For many years it became like a second national anthem before fading away. I have printed the words to the song at the very bottom of this page. Reading those words may give you some idea as to why the song is no longer popular. A 1958 Grand Orange Lodge of British America plaque is near the tree and reads as follows: Principal of nearby Leslieville Public School who was inspired to write Canada's national song ""The Maple Leaf Forever"" by the falling leaves of this sturdy maple tree.",Arts,/Pages/Alexander_Muir.html
1,43.66205,-79.37973,The Beatles,"Inside the former Maple Leaf Gardens, now a Loblaws, at the ""Canteen"" on the main level imbedded in the top of a table is this plaque. Here's what it says: Beatlemania wasn't quite dead, but it was clearly on the wane. In 1964, on the first North American tour, the Fab Four were greeted by 10,000 fans at the airport in Toronto, and were mobbed at their hotel - where one enterprising teenaged girl even managed to hide in their closet. Their two shows set an attendance record at Maple Leaf Gardens. A year later, when they rolled into town on the heels of their wild and triumphant concert at Shea Stadium, Gardens' owner Harold Ballard turned up the heat, turned off the water fountains, and made a fortune selling soft drinks as the lads from Liverpool again packed the arena for two shows. But by August 17, 1966, something had changed. John Lennon's crack about the band being more popular than Jesus had stirred controversy and protest. Only 800 fans were at the airport to greet the Beatles, and on the day of the shows, tickets were still available. As before, the Beatles only played a dozen songs, and were preceded by several opening acts - which included The Ronettes. Rumours abounded that this would be the band's final tour. ""It would be embarrassing to perform Long Tall Sally when we're 35,"" Paul McCartney said at the pre-concert press conference. ""We can't go on holding hands forever,"" John Lennon added. Writing in the Toronto Star, Arthur Zeldin had it right. He noted that the band didn't play some of their more ambitious recent songs like Eleanor Rigby live, because they couldn't replicate what they did in the studio on stage. Meanwhile, their more subtle numbers - Yesterday was a clear crowd favourite - were all but drowned out by the screaming. ""So, by the very forces of their musical experimentation and development, the Beatles may be taking themselves off the touring, mass live audience scene,"" Zeldin wrote. Maple Leaf Gardens was the only building the Beatles visited on all three of their North American tours, and after that show in 1966, they would play only eight more concerts, and then never do an official live show again. But of course, that was hardly the end of the story.-Stephen Brunt",Arts,/Pages/Beatles.html

Sandwell is best remembered as the influential editor (1932-1951) of Saturday Night, which he made the voice of English Canadian liberalism. B.K. was a prolific writer, whose ambition was to achieve clear thinking on human problems and who was read widely for his great wit, shrewdness and grace of expression.

Volkoff began choreographing shows for the Toronto Skating Club in 1934, and eventually built an international reputation for his ballets on ice. He would also earn the title ""the father of Canadian Ballet"". In his dance school, founded on this site in 1030, Volkoff inspired new generations of dancers, developed an audience to support their art, and created original Canadian works for them to perform, including ""The Red Ear of Corn"" (1949). Volkoff also founded one of Canada's earliest ballet companies and co-founded the influential Canadian Ballet Festival; both make possible the formation of The National Ballet of Canada in 1951.

The plaque information is courtesy of The Playing With Time Foundation. Here's what the large centre one says: Bruce Mackey was a long-time resident of Degrassi Street. In the 1970s he offered his encouragement and his home to a pair of young filmmakers, Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood. They were making a short children's film and Bruce's home became the set for what would be the very first Degrassi television episode. Bruce's enthusiasm for his diverse and lively neighbourhood was contagious and the early episodes of the Degrassi series prominently featured Degrassi Street homes, the grocery store, the local parks and schools. Linda and Kit embraced the essence of this east end neighbourhood and their work was lauded for its portrayal of real life in downtown Toronto. Bruce's observations of real school life were passed on to the producers and writers and were incorporated into storylines. Using local youngsters, many of Bruce's own students, as actors in the films, the multicultural flavour of the cast became a hallmark of the series. Over the next twenty years, until his untimely death from cancer in 1997, Bruce was a mentor to the filmmaking team. He provided them with ideas for scripts and locales, and he appeared in several episodes as the stern but caring teacher who peered at the Degrassi students over the rims of his glasses. To many of the Degrassi television family, he's fondly remembered as ""The Grandfather of Degrassi"".",Arts,/Pages/Bruce_Mackey_Degrassi.html

This Ontario Heritage Trust plaque just to the right inside these entrance gates of a building at the end of Castle Frank Road, south of Bloor Street East, tells the story: The wife of the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim was born at Whitchurch, Herefordshire, England. Orphaned at birth, she lived with her uncle, Admiral Samuel Graves, and subsequently married his god-son, John Graves Simcoe. She accompanied her husband to Upper Canada where she travelled extensively. Her diaries and sketches, compiled during these years, provide a vivid description and invaluable record of the colony's early life. In 1794, near this site, Mrs. Simcoe and her husband erected a summer house which they named ""Castle Frank"" in honour of their son.

11,43.66205,-79.37973,Elvis Presley,"Inside the former Maple Leaf Gardens, now a Loblaws, at the ""Canteen"" on the main level imbedded in the top of a table is this plaque. Here's what it says: On April 2, 1957, Elvis Presley came to Maple Leaf Gardens, and it's fair to say that Torontonians - at least the older generation - didn't know what hit them. The 22-year-old Presley was just a year removed from the release of his first major label album, and his popularity was skyrocketing. In the past year, he freely acknowledged having earned more than a million dollars. The two shows at Maple Leaf Gardens were played in front of the biggest crowds he had ever entertained, though the earlier set drew just 9,360, nearly 5,000 less than capacity. They also represented the first of only five concerts Presley would perform outside of the United States during his entire career, including two the next night in Ottawa. At the press conferences before his Toronto shows, Presley was relaxed and engaging, sitting cross-legged on a table backstage, while dealing with skeptical journalists and answering a series of largely ridiculous questions. ""He unabashedly admitted he couldn't understand classical music or opera, knows nothing about music and likes the shrieks of the teen-agers,"" the Globe and Mail reported. When Presley finally took the stage, following an opening segment that included a tap dancer, an Irish tenor (who was booed), and a comedian, flashbulbs exploded everywhere and those shrieks all but drowned out the sound coming from the stage. At the first 40-minute show Presley wore his famous gold lame suit in full for the last time. The press made much of Presley's gyrations and the primitive reactions they elicited from the crowd: ""a calculated psychological binge,"" one CBC commentator called it. But members of Presley's entourage remarked later that the Toronto fans were some of the best-behaved they encountered - perhaps because the 90 special police officers on site made any fan who leaped to their feet immediately return to their seat. Afterwards, local jazz musicians predicted that rock and roll was just a passing fad, and critics didn't attempt to hold back their disdain. ""It goes without saying he has the appeal of one-part dynamite and one-part chained-lightning to the adolescent girls; but to one like myself who is neither a girl nor adolescent, I could only feel he was strikingly devoid of talent,"" Hugh Thomson wrote in the Toronto Star.

Aboriginal peoples may have inhabited this site as early as 8,000 B.C. Scottish immigrant James McCowan settled this land for farming in 1833, calling it ""Springbank"" because of the springs running from the ancient shoreline of Lake Iroquois (predecessor of Lake Ontario) to the north. In 1939, Canadian artist Doris McCarthy purchased the easternmost part of Springbank, which her mother called ""Fool's Paradise"" because she considered it to be such an extravagant purchase.

It's located across the street from the apartment building George lived in while in Toronto. This set of two 2006 Heritage Toronto plaques have this to say: George Faludy is revered as one of Hungary's greatest poets. His writing, ranging from love lyrics to political satire to philosophical meditation, reflects a life committed to humanist ideals. A fearless critic of political oppression, Faludy fled arrest in Hungary in 1938 for his anti-Nazi views, and escaped the Holocaust with an invitation to the United States from President Roosevelt. Returning to Hungary after WWII, he was imprisoned by its Communist regime in Recsk, a brutal concentration camp, from 1950 to 1953. There he and a group of others sustained their spirits with secret night-time lectures on literature and history. Faludy left Hungary for England after the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and there wrote an extraordinary autobiography, My Happy Days In Hell. Internationally esteemed, he moved to Toronto in 1967. From here he continued to write and lecture, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Toronto in 1978. George Faludy lived at 25 St. Mary St. from 1975 until 1989 when he returned to Hungary after the collapse of Communism.
	Michelangelo's Last Prayer

	Your anvil is the earth, and with your right arm
	You span the arc of heaven like the sun.
	Eight decades on this scaffolding a - lifetime -
	I sought a sign of you, but there was none.

	Under my chisel marble fell to stonedust,
	But only torsos, idols would be born.
	I found you not, elusive, radiant, sunburst,
	Who glowed there pulsing under every stone.

	I have myself become an ancient stone block,
	Split by vines, a still, curmudgeonly old rock,
	But in my soul the old flame yet burns on.

	How can I shed this flesh that holds me prisoner?
	Strike me, if you can love a hoary sinner,
	Divine Sculptor, My God. I am the stone.

Here's what it tells us: This site was previously graced by a spacious Victorian mansion with gabled roofs and porticos. Originally built for the prominent Toronto surgeon Dr. J.F.W. Ross, it was acquired in 1913 by Professor Michael Hambourg, an internationally known piano pedagogue. With his wife Catherine and sons Jan and Boris, he established the Hambourg Conservatory of Music. Its spacious rooms and high ornate ceilings provided an ideal venue for such an institution. On the grand main stairway was a bronze statue of Mercury holding a torch which lit the way to the upper regions. Busts and reproductions of the great composers adorned the studios, and the hallways were festooned with inscribed photos of famous musicians and composers, together with posters, caricatures, concert programs and other memorabilia.Professor Hambourg, who had taught at the Moscow Conservatory, arrived in Canada with his family in 1910. The timing could not have been more propitious, and the idea of a musical institution, based on European concepts, appealed to many of the city's musical elite. Violinist Jan and cellist Boris were already known as brilliant performers, and Michael's oldest brother Mark, one of the world's leading concert pianists and resident in London, England, also lent the aura of his reputation. Michael and his sons were active members of the Arts & Letters Club of Toronto and frequent contributors to the various events.Under the aegis of the Hambourgs, eminent European teachers and performers were attracted to Toronto, and the Conservatory soon became a thriving hub of musical activity.

Considered among our finest poets, Isabella Crawford was born in Ireland and came to Canada with her parents about 1858. After settling first in Paisley, Ontario, the family lived later in Lakefield and Peterborough. As a young woman Isabella became fascinated by backwoods life and Indian legends. Following her father's death, she and her mother moved to Toronto. There they subsisted on her meagre earnings from light verse and 'formula fiction' that appeared in Canadian and American newspapers. One privately-printed book of serious poetry, 'Old Spookeses Pass, Malcom's Katie and Other Poems' appeared before her untimely death at 57 John Street. Full recognition came later, however, with the publication of her collected poems, which were admired for their evocative images of the lush and sparkling wilderness.'Darkness built its wigwam walls close around the camp'",Arts,/Pages/Isabella_Valancy_Crawford.html

It was intended to inspire and encourage hospital patients with imagery showing the richness of life.Architect Len Hurst first had the idea to incorporate a large mosaic mural in the design of the hospital lobby. Hurst was committed to putting art in public buildings. He looked at other hospitals before creating his proposal for Riverdale. Gatterbauer shared Hurst's commitment and enthusiasm. She wanted to create ""a very good work of art"" that would truly express the time for future generations.Gatterbauer prepared a full-size watercolour painting of the composition for approval before starting on the mosaic. The total cost, including design, was $17,000.The following poem, written in 1962 explains the mosaics symbolism.The Meaning of LifeThe SUN is the most important requisite for life on earth.The FAMILY group is the source of human life and the foundation of our civilization.MAN holding the planets symbolizes the source of strength, exploration, and discovery.WOMAN sitting on the earth symbolizes her duties and responsibilities for creation and family life.The CHILDREN protected by man and wife are God's trust and man's hope for the future.The ROCKS, EARTH, FOREST, and WATER were the beginning; after millions of years mankind developed a civilization.The giant step from man's first erectness to our present day life is symbolized in the mural by the RAINBOW as the connecting link between nature or primitive society to the floating city or present day civilization.FISH and BIRDS, WATER and SKY are our steady companions.The MOON is the reciprocation of the sun as night is to day.MOUNTAINS and ROCKS symbolize the obstacles over which we struggle to survive and conquer.",Arts,/Pages/Life.html

On November 4, 1993, the headliners were a trio from Seattle called Nirvana, playing in front of 8,500 fans in a scaled-down version of the Gardens. Only two years before, on the same day the album Nevermind was released - the record that would make them reluctant superstars - the band had played a brilliant, chaotic set at a small Toronto club in front of only a few hundred fans. Their style was dubbed grunge, a rough, edgy and dark rejection of the excesses of big, corporate rock, just as punk had been fifteen years earlier, and like so many acts before them, they were viewed as the musical voice of a disaffected generation. But now Nirvana were arena rockers themselves, who had sold millions upon millions of records, and it was hard not to sense their discomfort. The band's lead singer Kurt Cobain was described by Toronto reviewers as ""sullen"" onstage, and the band pointedly declined to perform its biggest hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit. As it turned out, Nirvana would never be back. Four months later, they played their last show in Munich.

In 1966, Souster helped to establish the League of Canadian Poets, serving as its first president. Souster tirelessly championed Canadian poetry, viewing it as a community art.Souster received the Governor General's Award for Poetry in 1964 and the City of Toronto Book Award in 1980.

69,43.66205,-79.37973,The Beatles,"Inside the former Maple Leaf Gardens, now a Loblaws, at the ""Canteen"" on the main level imbedded in the top of a table is this plaque. Here's what it says: Beatlemania wasn't quite dead, but it was clearly on the wane. In 1964, on the first North American tour, the Fab Four were greeted by 10,000 fans at the airport in Toronto, and were mobbed at their hotel - where one enterprising teenaged girl even managed to hide in their closet. Their two shows set an attendance record at Maple Leaf Gardens. A year later, when they rolled into town on the heels of their wild and triumphant concert at Shea Stadium, Gardens' owner Harold Ballard turned up the heat, turned off the water fountains, and made a fortune selling soft drinks as the lads from Liverpool again packed the arena for two shows. But by August 17, 1966, something had changed. John Lennon's crack about the band being more popular than Jesus had stirred controversy and protest. Only 800 fans were at the airport to greet the Beatles, and on the day of the shows, tickets were still available. As before, the Beatles only played a dozen songs, and were preceded by several opening acts - which included The Ronettes. Rumours abounded that this would be the band's final tour. ""It would be embarrassing to perform Long Tall Sally when we're 35,"" Paul McCartney said at the pre-concert press conference. ""We can't go on holding hands forever,"" John Lennon added. Writing in the Toronto Star, Arthur Zeldin had it right. He noted that the band didn't play some of their more ambitious recent songs like Eleanor Rigby live, because they couldn't replicate what they did in the studio on stage. Meanwhile, their more subtle numbers - Yesterday was a clear crowd favourite - were all but drowned out by the screaming. ""So, by the very forces of their musical experimentation and development, the Beatles may be taking themselves off the touring, mass live audience scene,"" Zeldin wrote. Maple Leaf Gardens was the only building the Beatles visited on all three of their North American tours, and after that show in 1966, they would play only eight more concerts, and then never do an official live show again. But of course, that was hardly the end of the story.-Stephen Brunt",Arts,/Pages/Beatles.html

In the 1970s he offered his encouragement and his home to a pair of young filmmakers, Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood. They were making a short children's film and Bruce's home became the set for what would be the very first Degrassi television episode. Bruce's enthusiasm for his diverse and lively neighbourhood was contagious and the early episodes of the Degrassi series prominently featured Degrassi Street homes, the grocery store, the local parks and schools. Linda and Kit embraced the essence of this east end neighbourhood and their work was lauded for its portrayal of real life in downtown Toronto. Bruce's observations of real school life were passed on to the producers and writers and were incorporated into storylines. Using local youngsters, many of Bruce's own students, as actors in the films, the multicultural flavour of the cast became a hallmark of the series. Over the next twenty years, until his untimely death from cancer in 1997, Bruce was a mentor to the filmmaking team. He provided them with ideas for scripts and locales, and he appeared in several episodes as the stern but caring teacher who peered at the Degrassi students over the rims of his glasses.

Here's what it says: On April 2, 1957, Elvis Presley came to Maple Leaf Gardens, and it's fair to say that Torontonians - at least the older generation - didn't know what hit them. The 22-year-old Presley was just a year removed from the release of his first major label album, and his popularity was skyrocketing. In the past year, he freely acknowledged having earned more than a million dollars. The two shows at Maple Leaf Gardens were played in front of the biggest crowds he had ever entertained, though the earlier set drew just 9,360, nearly 5,000 less than capacity. They also represented the first of only five concerts Presley would perform outside of the United States during his entire career, including two the next night in Ottawa. At the press conferences before his Toronto shows, Presley was relaxed and engaging, sitting cross-legged on a table backstage, while dealing with skeptical journalists and answering a series of largely ridiculous questions. ""He unabashedly admitted he couldn't understand classical music or opera, knows nothing about music and likes the shrieks of the teen-agers,"" the Globe and Mail reported. When Presley finally took the stage, following an opening segment that included a tap dancer, an Irish tenor (who was booed), and a comedian, flashbulbs exploded everywhere and those shrieks all but drowned out the sound coming from the stage. At the first 40-minute show Presley wore his famous gold lame suit in full for the last time. The press made much of Presley's gyrations and the primitive reactions they elicited from the crowd: ""a calculated psychological binge,"" one CBC commentator called it. But members of Presley's entourage remarked later that the Toronto fans were some of the best-behaved they encountered - perhaps because the 90 special police officers on site made any fan who leaped to their feet immediately return to their seat. Afterwards, local jazz musicians predicted that rock and roll was just a passing fad, and critics didn't attempt to hold back their disdain. ""It goes without saying he has the appeal of one-part dynamite and one-part chained-lightning to the adolescent girls; but to one like myself who is neither a girl nor adolescent, I could only feel he was strikingly devoid of talent,"" Hugh Thomson wrote in the Toronto Star.

It's located across the street from the apartment building George lived in while in Toronto. This set of two 2006 Heritage Toronto plaques have this to say: George Faludy is revered as one of Hungary's greatest poets. His writing, ranging from love lyrics to political satire to philosophical meditation, reflects a life committed to humanist ideals. A fearless critic of political oppression, Faludy fled arrest in Hungary in 1938 for his anti-Nazi views, and escaped the Holocaust with an invitation to the United States from President Roosevelt. Returning to Hungary after WWII, he was imprisoned by its Communist regime in Recsk, a brutal concentration camp, from 1950 to 1953. There he and a group of others sustained their spirits with secret night-time lectures on literature and history. Faludy left Hungary for England after the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and there wrote an extraordinary autobiography, My Happy Days In Hell. Internationally esteemed, he moved to Toronto in 1967. From here he continued to write and lecture, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Toronto in 1978. George Faludy lived at 25 St. Mary St. from 1975 until 1989 when he returned to Hungary after the collapse of Communism.
	Michelangelo's Last Prayer
	by George Faludy

	Your anvil is the earth, and with your right arm
	You span the arc of heaven like the sun.
	Eight decades on this scaffolding a - lifetime -
	I sought a sign of you, but there was none.

	Under my chisel marble fell to stonedust,
	But only torsos, idols would be born.
	I found you not, elusive, radiant, sunburst,
	Who glowed there pulsing under every stone.

	I have myself become an ancient stone block,
	Split by vines, a still, curmudgeonly old rock,
	But in my soul the old flame yet burns on.

	How can I shed this flesh that holds me prisoner?
	Strike me, if you can love a hoary sinner,
	Divine Sculptor, My God. I am the stone.

Here's what it tells us: This site was previously graced by a spacious Victorian mansion with gabled roofs and porticos. Originally built for the prominent Toronto surgeon Dr. J.F.W. Ross, it was acquired in 1913 by Professor Michael Hambourg, an internationally known piano pedagogue. With his wife Catherine and sons Jan and Boris, he established the Hambourg Conservatory of Music. Its spacious rooms and high ornate ceilings provided an ideal venue for such an institution. On the grand main stairway was a bronze statue of Mercury holding a torch which lit the way to the upper regions. Busts and reproductions of the great composers adorned the studios, and the hallways were festooned with inscribed photos of famous musicians and composers, together with posters, caricatures, concert programs and other memorabilia.Professor Hambourg, who had taught at the Moscow Conservatory, arrived in Canada with his family in 1910. The timing could not have been more propitious, and the idea of a musical institution, based on European concepts, appealed to many of the city's musical elite. Violinist Jan and cellist Boris were already known as brilliant performers, and Michael's oldest brother Mark, one of the world's leading concert pianists and resident in London, England, also lent the aura of his reputation. Michael and his sons were active members of the Arts & Letters Club of Toronto and frequent contributors to the various events.Under the aegis of the Hambourgs, eminent European teachers and performers were attracted to Toronto, and the Conservatory soon became a thriving hub of musical activity. Recognized not only for the excellence of its teachers, it was the alma mater of some of Canada's most noted musicians. On occasion, glittering parties honouring visiting celebrities were held on the premises. After Michael's untimely death in 1915, Boris was appointed Director of the Conservatory and with his wife, Maria, continued the tradition for another 38 years.The Conservatory was also the headquarters of the world famous Hart House String Quartet established in 1924 by the Rt. Hon. Vincent Massey, then Governor-General of Canada.

One privately-printed book of serious poetry, 'Old Spookeses Pass, Malcom's Katie and Other Poems' appeared before her untimely death at 57 John Street.

She wanted to create ""a very good work of art"" that would truly express the time for future generations.Gatterbauer prepared a full-size watercolour painting of the composition for approval before starting on the mosaic. The total cost, including design, was $17,000.The following poem, written in 1962 explains the mosaics symbolism.The Meaning of LifeThe SUN is the most important requisite for life on earth.The FAMILY group is the source of human life and the foundation of our civilization.MAN holding the planets symbolizes the source of strength, exploration, and discovery.WOMAN sitting on the earth symbolizes her duties and responsibilities for creation and family life.The CHILDREN protected by man and wife are God's trust and man's hope for the future.The ROCKS, EARTH, FOREST, and WATER were the beginning; after millions of years mankind developed a civilization.The giant step from man's first erectness to our present day life is symbolized in the mural by the RAINBOW as the connecting link between nature or primitive society to the floating city or present day civilization.FISH and BIRDS, WATER and SKY are our steady companions.The MOON is the reciprocation of the sun as night is to day.MOUNTAINS and ROCKS symbolize the obstacles over which we struggle to survive and conquer.",Arts,/Pages/Life.html

Here's what it says: From the earliest days of rock and roll, being booked to play Maple Leaf Gardens was a sure sign that you'd hit the big time. Going all the way back to 1956, when Bill Haley and the Comets headlined what was the first true rock concert in Toronto, the arena played host to all the major touring acts, from Elvis Presley, to the Beatles, to Chuck Berry, to the Rolling Stones, to Bob Dylan, to Jimi Hendrix, to Elton John, to Led Zeppelin, to Bruce Springsteen, to Neil Young, to Madonna - and, more than anyone else, to hometown boys Rush. On November 4, 1993, the headliners were a trio from Seattle called Nirvana, playing in front of 8,500 fans in a scaled-down version of the Gardens. Only two years before, on the same day the album Nevermind was released - the record that would make them reluctant superstars - the band had played a brilliant, chaotic set at a small Toronto club in front of only a few hundred fans. Their style was dubbed grunge, a rough, edgy and dark rejection of the excesses of big, corporate rock, just as punk had been fifteen years earlier, and like so many acts before them, they were viewed as the musical voice of a disaffected generation. But now Nirvana were arena rockers themselves, who had sold millions upon millions of records, and it was hard not to sense their discomfort. The band's lead singer Kurt Cobain was described by Toronto reviewers as ""sullen"" onstage, and the band pointedly declined to perform its biggest hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit. As it turned out, Nirvana would never be back. Four months later, they played their last show in Munich. Five month later, Cobain was dead, a suicide at age 27.-Stephen Brunt",Arts,/Pages/Nirvana.html

It moved to the current site on Humberside in 1894 with the construction of a new building designed by Ellis. In 1909, one year after the Junction became the City of West Toronto, the community held its celebration here when Toronto and West Toronto amalgamated. The auditorium includes a mural by Group of Seven artist Arthur Lismer. This work took 6 years to complete and is painted in oils on five canvas panels. The central panel shows Truth, Wisdom, Courage, Beauty, Innocence and Devotion while the other panels show representations of the various populations of Canada - Native, French and English.High Park Avenue was once home to some of the wealthiest and most important families in the Junction. Its tree lined boulevard reflects the ""City Beautiful"" movement of the late nineteenth century. 204 High Park Avenue was one of the many grand Junction houses designed by Ellis and is noted for its mixture of stone and red brick masonry. This house was designed for James T. Jackson in 1890; an early Junction real estate agent who co-founded the Junction's first newspaper in 1888. Also designed by Ellis and Connery and funded with a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, the Annette Street Library opened as the West Toronto Library in 1909. A condition of the Carnegie grant was that the library included public lecture rooms in its design. These are located in the basement and are still in use today. Ellis and Connery also designed the nearby Masonic Temple which opened shortly after the library. Like many other important Junction men of his day, Ellis was an active freemason. Ellis could be described as the man who built the Junction.",Builders,/Pages/James_Augustus_Ellis_of_the_Junction.html

This is what it says: Weston is distinguished by many retaining walls constructed from Humber River stone. One man, skilled stonemason James Gilbert Gove, built a number of these walls, as well as a war memorial in this park. Before immigrating to Canada, James Gove acquired his exemplary skills in the southwest of England. Living and working in the Weston area for the remainder of his life, he often used stone gathered from the nearby Humber River for his projects - breaking large rocks with a heavy hammer, then carefully shaping each one before arranging them in the wall according to size and colour. A veteran of WWI, he was particularly proud of the war memorial and plaza in this park, just a short walk from his home (now demolished) two blocks away on Weston Road. Designed by James Shaw, the memorial was completed by Gove in 1950. In 2007, Weston's riverstone walls and war memorial were officially recognized as an important part of the community's unique identity and heritage.",Builders,/Pages/James_Gilbert_Gove.html

Here's what it says: This magnificent dome represents an extensive legacy of stained glass produced by the McCausland family and their employees for buildings throughout Canada. In business under various company names since 1856, the Toronto-based firm Robert McCausland Limited is credited with the earliest and most numerous examples of Canadian stained glass and the longest record for glasswork in North America.

On one of these standards you will see, facing north, this 2001 Heritage Toronto plaque. Here's what it says: In 1918, at 12 years of age, Nat broke into the movie business by selling ads on the back of Hollywood postcards - 1,000 for $3 - to Queen Street movie theatres. When he entered university in 1923, he was already operating his father's Monarch Theatre on College Street. In 1934, Nat formed Twentieth Century Theatres, which ran 72 Ontario theatres at its peak. In 1946, with associates, he created a foreign film distribution house (IFD), and in 1958, they built Toronto International Film Studios in Kleinburg. During those years, Taylor built the Twin Cinema, the International Cinema and the Glendale Theatre in Toronto; all now vanished. Toronto-born and bred, Nat pioneered the multiple theatre concept by dualling the Elgin Theatre in Ottawa in 1957. In 1969 he adapted the Loew's Uptown in Toronto into five screens. And in 1979 Taylor created a new company, Cineplex, and built the first multiplex - comprising 18 theatres - in Toronto's Eaton Centre. The multiplex concept saved many old theatres from destruction and changed the way people go to the movies all over the world.",Builders,/Pages/Nathan_Taylor.html

Five successive generations of the McCausland family have provided its presidents: Joseph, Robert, Alan, Gordon and Andrew. Joseph McCausland (1828-1905), an Irish immigrant, came to Toronto in 1835 and in 1856 founded the Canadian Stained Glass Works. Under the direction of his son, Robert McCausland, (1856-1923) OSA, RCA, the firm acquired its present title, and his award-winning designs won international acclaim.

Thomas emigrated from England in 1843 and was responsible for such notable landmarks as St. Lawrence Hall, St. Michael's Cathedral and the Don Jail in this city. His many other Canadian works include Brock's Monument at Queenston, as well as churches and public buildings in Guelph, Halifax, Hamilton, London, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Quebec City.

IV. This land had been rented and cleared for farming by Josué L'Amoreaux and his sons, United Empire Loyalists of French Huguenot origin, who settled here in 1808. In 1846 the Wesleyan Methodists of this area, led by Reverend T. Turner, built a small frame church amid the fields of Christie's farm. These settlers and their descendants worshipped here for 80 years. After the congregation was absorbed into the United Church in 1925, the chapel was closed. In 1936, a fire destroyed nearby St. Paul's Church and the Anglicans used Christie's Chapel until their church was rebuilt.

177,43.638125,-79.409437,Military Burial Ground,"Attached to this wall of headstones in a cemetery at the west end of Garrison Common at 100 Garrison Road, just before the entrance to Fort York, is this 1970 Toronto Historical Board plaque. Here's what it says: This cemetery opened in 1860 and was the third military burial ground in Toronto. It replaced one situated a short distance to the west, which was abandoned after a few burials and the bodies were moved to this location. The last known interment here was in 1911.The following is an extract from Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto, Vol. 1, 1894:There are about two hundred graves distinguishable by the mounds of earth. In the whole cemetery there are only twenty-eight stones or wooden slabs standing to tell who lies beneath. A few broken stories have fallen; most of them are indecipherable and the rest are nameless. All the headstones are of the simplest and plainest character. There is not a monument or shaft in the yard. On a few graves are simple wooden crosses without any inscription. Here and there is a square picketed enclosure about a grave, the fence in a very dilapidated condition and overgrown with grass, thistles and ivy. But one grave bears token that its occupant is still cherished in memory. The grave is that of Sergeant-Major F.W. Gathercole, of the Canadian School of Infantry, who died at the new fort, Toronto, February 13, 1883, aged forty-two years. A neat marble slab, simple but quite as pretentious as any in the cemetery, bears the inscription that it was erected by his comrades in affectionate remembrance. About the grave the grass and thistles have been cleared away, and four pots of geraniums in bloom had been placed on it. The stone marking the resting place of assistant Commissary-General, John Moirs McLean Sutherland, is broken and down. Everything about the grounds bears evidence that they are seldom visited. The proportion of soldiers drowned among the twenty-eight whose names are decipherable is large. They are John Manley Rattle, Deputy Assistant Commissary-General, J. Ramsey Akers, Ensign in the 16th Regiment, James Walsh, Private in the 30th Regiment, and Corporal John Smeeton, of the 13th Hussars. Several graves are those of the wives and children of soldiers. The head stones range in date, from 1860 down to that of Private E. A. Heath, of the Canadian School of Infantry, who died in 1885, being the most recent. Among the graves is one of Walter Toronto Lewis, the one-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Lewis, who died in 1868. The 13th Hussars has the greatest number of burials. At two graves are tiny marble slabs, not over five inches wide and a foot high, bearing simply the inscriptions: ""G. M. and G. F. S."". They are evidently remembered, for loving hands had recently propped up the broken and fallen memorials with pieces of wood. Most of the stones bear inscriptions to the effect that they were erected by comrades. But little attempt at decoration has been made on the slabs. Here and there is a flag, a pair of crossed swords, a wreath, a cross, a crown, and other usual emblems of this character all very simply executed. Among the dead who lie here are: Trumpeter James McMahon, 13th Hassars; Rachel, wife of Sergeant-Major William Ross, of the 4th Artillery; Isabella Thompson, Private George Miller, 13th Hussars, and Colour-Sergeant John Hanney, 47th Regiment.",Cemeteries,/Pages/Military_Burial_Ground.html

At that time the City of Toronto had a population of about 68,000 people with its northern boundary at Bloor Street. A toll gate stood on Gallows Hill on Yonge Street, just south of St. Clair Avenue.

Here's what it tells us:  Established in 1890, this cemetery contains the remains of 1,511 individuals who died at the Mimico Asylum/Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital. Construction of the hospital on its 24 scenic hectares beside Lake Ontario began in the 1880s, as a healthy respite facility for patients who would be transferred from the Province's existing asylums.The ""Mimico Branch Asylum"" opened on January 21, 1890 under the administration of the Asylum for the Insane, Toronto (later renamed the Queen Street Mental Health Centre). It received its first 116 patients on that day from Toronto, with the exception of ten male patient labourers who had been resident since 1889 to prepare the site for later occupants. In 1892, it was decided that the Mimico Asylum (so renamed) should become a fully integrated facility in its own right, rather than a ""long-stay patient only"" branch, which it remained until it closed and partially re-merged with the Queen Street facility in 1979.The first burial at this cemetery took place in 1890 and the last in 1974. For 84 years, the cemetery at Mimico was used to bury patients who had no family or lacked sufficient funds to make other arrangements. The cemetery was divided in half by a central north-south road. Roman Catholics where buried on the west side of the cemetery and the Protestants were buried primarily on the east side. The rows are marked at each end by a small square stone inscribed with a letter or number corresponding to the burial register. There are 50 graves per row, aligned two end to end, by 25 across.

This 2005 plaque has this to say: Richview Cemetery's oldest surviving monument records the death of Ann Garbutt who was interred in 1846, before the official establishment of this burial site. In 1853, William Knaggs sold this land from his farm for a chapel and lot without belonging to any particular church or denomination, to be respectively devoted exclusively to religious purposes in the discretion of certain trustees, namely Mark Dawson, Robert Coulter, and William Tuer. By 1850, the Union Chapel on the site had been joined by two other local congregations. The chapel and its cemetery served Richview, a small rural community bounded by present-day Dixon Road, Rathburn Road, Kipling Avenue, and Renforth Drive. Richview consisted of farms, a post office, blacksmith, church and school. In 1888, William and Sarah Knaggs donated additional property, south of the cemetery, upon which a new building, depicted above, was constructed. It was named Richview Methodist Church (later Richview United Church). The vast development of Highway 427 led to the relocation of the congregation in 1959, the demolition of the church building, and the dramatic surroundings of the cemetery today. In the 1970s the McFarlane family cemetery and the Willow Grove Burying Ground were moved from their original sites and relocated here.

Here's what it has to say: Toronto's first Roman Catholic Cemetery was beside St. Paul's Church in east downtown Toronto which was established as a Parish in 1822. This cemetery was rapidly filled as a result of the many deaths following the hardships suffered after the 1847 Irish potato famine. By the mid-1850's another catholic cemetery was needed to serve the growing number of Parishes in Toronto. Purchased in 1854 by the Bishop of Toronto, Rt. Rev. Armand Francois Marie, Comte De Charbonnel, St. Michael's Cemetery was opened in 1855 at the present location in Deer Park, then well north of the City of Toronto. His successor, Bishop John Joseph Lynch, enlarged the cemetery in 1866. To meet the needs of the ever increasing catholic population Mount Hope Cemetery was opened in 1900 in North Toronto. Originally St. Michael's Cemetery was administered by the Rector of St. Michael's Cathedral. The Toronto Catholic Cemetery Association assumed the responsibility in 1961.

The chapel, whose arch is the most prominent decorative feature, has a distinctly Gothic motif, including the large arched stained glass window lighting the nave and the arched rose window of stained glass lighting the sanctuary and chancel. An unique aspect of the chapel's architecture is the placement of the bell tower at the rear, over the sacristy, a sensible design for funeral processions entering through the porch and passing through the large nave to the chancel and finally through the sacristy to the cemetery grounds. Henry Langley, a Toronto architect, was noted for his use of Gothic Revival style in churches. He died in 1906 at the age of seventy, and was buried in the Toronto Necropolis (Section O, Lot 255).",Cemeteries,/Pages/Toronto_Necropolis_Chapel.html
193,43.64263,-79.40013,Victoria Memorial Square,"Located at the southwest corner of Wellington Street West and Portland Street, a block east of Bathurst Street, is this Square. There are many plaques here. This set of two has this to say: Early YearsPart of the Fort York National Historic Site, this park shelters the city's earliest known cemetery to be established by British authorities. In 1794, shortly after the founding of the fort and the Town of York, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe ordered this burying ground laid out in a clearing a short distance from the fort. Simcoe's own infant daughter Katherine was the first to be buried here. At least 400 others - many of them soldiers with their wives and children - were laid to rest in the cemetery before it was closed in 1863.By then much had changed. In 1837, a plan of subdivision extended the city's street grid westward into the area. The cemetery, oriented by compass to magnetic north (unlike the roads), was enclosed within a new 2.4 ha public square named after Princess Victoria. Victoria Square was mirrored by Clarence Square to the east, and linked to it by an exceptionally wide boulevard called ""Wellington Place."" Intended to create a prestigious neighbourhood, the subdivision plan called for churches to be built in Victoria Square. However, only the Anglican Church of St. John the Evangelist was ever constructed.From Burying Ground to Public Park As the neighbourhood around Victoria Square filled in, .8 of the square's original 2.4 ha were lost to private development or used for the extension of Wellington Street. The cemetery itself suffered vandalism and use as a cattle pasture until the 1880s, when the City moved to protect it by converting it into a public park. The surviving grave markers were removed to the park's western edge, the uneven grave sites levelled, and walks laid out. In 1899, a marble tablet explaining the significant of this place was erected by the Canadian Club of Toronto as part of the city's first series of historical markers. The remarkable monument in the centre of the park was completed in 1907.By the mid-20th century, the area surrounding the park was dominated by industry, and Victoria Square's history was largely forgotten. Beginning in the 1990s, the move of new businesses and residents into this area transformed it yet again. In 2007, a plan was approved to rehabilitate the park and celebrate its past. Today, hundreds of graves remain largely undisturbed beneath the grass of Victoria Memorial Square.",Cemeteries,/Pages/Victoria_Memorial_Square.html

This was the beginning of the Washington Church, named in honour of a local evangelical lay preacher, Stephen Washington. In 1838, the first frame church was built facing Kingston Road on land donated by Levi Annis. The early Annis pioneers used this site as a family burial ground and donated it to the church in 1825.

York, as Toronto was first known, had been settled only 42 years earlier. Prior to that, the shore of Lake Ontario had been the hunting and fishing grounds of the Mississauga First Nations. George Michie (pronounced ""Mickey"") initially sold ""iron mongery,"" stovepipes, linens, dry goods, food stuffs, building materials, fine wine from France, and spirits from nearby Gooderham & Worts Distillery. His business thrived as the intersection of Yonge and King Streets evolved into the commercial centre of the rapidly growing city. By 1861, streetcar tracks were laid on both streets, providing patrons with easy access during and after work. Michie's original plain, Georgian-style, three-storey brick store was improved in 1893 with a more elaborate red-brick-and-sandstone structure. It was soon dwarfed by its neighbours: the 12-storey Dominion Bank (1914), the Canadian Pacific Railway Building (18 storeys, 1913) and the Royal Bank Building (20 storeys, 1915). In 1915, the liquor attracted the attention of police enforcing the Ontario Temperance Act (similar to America's Prohibition Act of 1919). But the storm passed. Michie's business lasted until 1947, when the shop was sold to Robert Simpson Company.

Michie's carried an inventory that included such exotic items in the 1800s as Valencia oranges, figs, spices and imported cognac. The company's insistence that service was as important as quality quickly led to Michie's becoming the pre-eminent retail destination in all of Toronto. This was the golden age of customer service where the sales clerk signed each hand-written bill with ""Your most faithful servant."" Michie's customers, whose names could be found in any book listing the country's Who's Who, made their way to the busy King and Yonge corner from all parts of the city and surrounding countryside. The transaction completed, servants would load the goods on wagons prior to the homeward trip to Rosedale, affluent Parkdale, or far off Richmond Hill. Michie's continued as a family run business until 1947 when John Forbes Michie, the grandnephew of founder George, sold the company to the Simpsons Company. At about the same time Michie's was opening its doors in Toronto, a baker named Marcel Thuet was setting up his shop ""Boulangerie Thuet"" in the Haut-Rhin region of Alsace, France. Out of this tiny village bakery comes the 200 year old starter that is still used in all Thuet breads today.

Here's what it says: 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion 24 March 1945 For his gallantry in the face of enemy fire on March 24, 1945, Corporal Fred Topham, 27, a medical orderly in the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, received the Victoria Cross, the Commonwealth's highest award for bravery on the field of battle. In one of the final engagements of World War II, his battalion had parachuted into a strongly-defended area east of the River Rhine. While treating casualties, Cpl Topham saw two medical orderlies killed while giving aid to another wounded man. Taking over from the dead orderlies under intense fire, Cpl Topham was shot in the face. Despite severe bleeding and pain, he dressed the soldier's wounds and carried him to safety. Refusing treatment for his own injury and continuing to disregard withering enemy small-arms, rifle and machine gun fire, Cpl Topham worked steadily to aid and bring in wounded men. Hours later, his own wound treated, despite being ordered to evacuate, he returned to duty, enroute coming across a Bren Gun Carrier which had received a direct hit. Enemy mortar bombs were landing, the carrier was burning fiercely and its ammunition was exploding. Regardless, while under fierce attack, he rescued the three occupants of the carrier. Although one died, Cpl Topham's actions undoubtedly saved the lives of the other two men. The Toronto-born soldier showed gallantry of the highest order. For six hours, most of the time in great pain, Cpl Fred Topham performed a sustained series of acts of outstanding bravery, and his magnificent and selfless courage inspired all those who witnessed it.

The house itself faces Yonge Street and in its past had great lawns and gardens reaching to that street. Here's what this Ontario Heritage Trust plaque on the site says: This building, a good example of an early Victorian farm-house was completed in 1851 by David Gibson. Born in Glamis Parish, Forfarshire, Scotland, Gibson emigrated to Upper Canada where, in 1825, he was appointed a Deputy Land Surveyor. He was an ardent supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie, and was twice elected as a Reform member to the provincial parliament. One of Mackenzie's chief lieutenants in the unsuccessful Rebellion of 1837, he fled to the United States. His house was burned by order of the Lieutenant-Governor, Francis Bond Head, and his property was made subject to forfeiture.

On April 27, 1813, it was part of a larger battlefield after some 2,500 American soldiers, sailors and volunteers attacked York by land and water. Across this ground, American troops advanced on Fort York and the Town of York, which were defended by about 1,000 troops comprising British Regulars, Canadian Militia, First Nations Warriors and civilians. By the end of the battle, U.S. forces suffered 320 dead and wounded while York's casualties numbered about 157.Garrison Common survives as part of the original 1793 Military Reserve lands cleared for use by the British Army around the fort. As part of a broader fortification system, army engineers created unobstructed defensive fields around forts. In the case of Fort York, ""The Common"" gave the watchful eyes of the fort's sentries a clear view of the lands west of the fort.In peacetime, military commons were shared with the civilian population for public gatherings and sporting events. Open, level fields were well-suited to equestrian events and shooting competitions. Bridging the gap between the military and civilians was important in garrison towns like York (Toronto) because of the political, social and economic ties between the two groups.

The Grand Magazine stored about 300 barrels of black gunpowder and small arms ammunition.The retreating British detonated the magazine to halt American attackers and to prevent military stores from falling into U.S. hands. The resulting explosion was responsible for 263 dead and wounded, mostly American.

276,43.64878,-79.378254,Rebellion of 1837,"At 1 King Street West (the white tower on the right) at the elevator lobby on the 31st floor, is this Bruce Bell and Dana King plaque. Here's what it says: Sir Francis Bond Head, a handsome, accomplished, adventuresome, former cavalry officer who had fought beside Wellington at Waterloo, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada in 1836. Legend says it was a misprint on an official document that brought Sir Francis over from England, as it was his cousin, Edmund, who really was in line for the job. In honour of the new Governor, James Bell, being a staunch Tory, renamed his Coopers Inn tavern on Church Street the Sir Francis Bond Head Inn. At first, Sir Francis, who lived in the Governor's mansion on the site of present-day Roy Thompson Hall, was willing to listen to reformers like William Lyon Mackenzie and they, in turn, were happy to have Sir Francis as Lt. Governor, because his predecessor, Sir John Colborne, was a member of the much-despised ruling elite, the so-called Family Compact. However, Sir Francis stopped listening to the reformers and started to side with the elite after realizing it was they who could give him what he really wanted: power. In order to keep in the good books with the Family Compact, Sir Francis called an election after dissolving the assembly and, just to make sure the Tories (the Family Compact party of choice) won, he decreed that only men who owned property could vote. Immediately thereafter, Sir Francis issued hundreds of land deeds (along with free booze) to anybody who would vote Tory. That one act of disgusting largess was to be a turning point in Canadian history. Soon whispers of a rebellion began to seep out from the taverns, hotels, theatres and coffee shops that once lined our streets, with the loudest murmur coming from inside the Mackenzie camp. On Monday, December 4, 1837, rebels started gathering at Montgomery's Tavern, now near the corner of Eglinton and Yonge Streets, where food and other supplies were to be organized. Men from outlying communities began to arrive in small and large groups, but no precise numbers are known. Beginning at nightfall on December 5th, 1837, the infamous government-backed fighting force known as the McGraw Troupe rode en mass down Church Street to the Sir Francis Bond Head Inn, where they dismounted, stabled their horses in a barn behind the Inn, downed a few pints, made their plans for the following day, and went to bed. The next morning, Wednesday, December 6th, 1837, the McGraw Troupe, all saddled up, galloped down Colborne Street and went on to meet up with Sir Francis and his 1000 volunteers. With the Union Jacks billowing in the wind and their fife and drum band reverberating patriotic tunes, they headed up Yonge Street to meet Mackenzie's men. The proposed march down Yonge Street by Mackenzie was planned as an attempted revolution to seize the arms and ammunition that were stored in Toronto's then city hall, now the site of St. Lawrence Hall, and use those weapons to force the government to surrender in a bloodless coup. During the week of the rebellion more than 700 men would arrive at Montgomery's Tavern, although it is estimated no more than 500 rebels were gathered together at any one time. Colonel Moodie, with six other loyalists, attempted to ride through the rebel roadblock to warn Governor Bond Head in Toronto. Moodie fired his pistol, apparently over the heads of the rebels, the opening shot in the rebellion in Upper Canada. A number of the rebels returned fire, killing Moodie. But now Mackenzie hesitated rather than striking directly into the city. This gave Governor Bond Head a chance to organize. The lack of action also led to more desertions from the rebel side. On Thursday, December 7th, Anthony van Egmond, a veteran military commander, arrived to be the military leader of Mackenzie's rebellion. Immediately, he realized the rebel forces on hand were desperately insufficient and advised an urgent withdrawal. Instead, Mackenzie remained and awaited the government counterattack. Fellow rebel Peter Matthews was given 60 riflemen and sent to the Don River Bridge as a diversion, but they were driven off. The main rebel force left at the tavern numbered just 400, with only 200 of those with firearms. In the distance, bagpipes could be heard announcing the approaching government forces. A brief exchange of gunfire occurred, but the heavily outnumbered rebels fled after a few minutes, suffering numerous dead and wounded. Mackenzie escaped to the hills and on to the United States, as did many other rebels. And so ended the Rebellion of 1837 here in Upper Canada. In the aftermath of the Rebellion came a Tory reign of terror with 25 rebels executed in Upper Canada and 12 men in Lower Canada (Quebec). The patriots of Upper Canada were either shot or hanged here in Toronto, London and Niagara-on-the-Lake with 150 more sentences to banishment in Van Damien's Land, now Tasmania, and to Sydney, Australia. And to the victors? Huge celebrations back at the Sir Francis Bond Head Inn for a job well done. In reality we the people did eventually win when, in 1848, fellow reformer Robert Baldwin successfully introduced Responsible Government into Canadian Parliament where, for the first time, the Government would be responsible to the people rather than the other way around.",Conflict,/Pages/Rebellion_of_1837.html

Toronto was a predominately British and Protestant city struggling through the Great Depression, and youths in several neighbourhoods were harassing those they considered ""foreigners"". Widespread prejudice against Jews made them particular targets. Two nights earlier, on August 14, fans of the predominately Jewish ""Harbord Playground"" team were provoked by local ""Pit Gang"" members with a makeshift swastika, a symbol made familiar by the recent rise to power of the Nazi party in Germany. At the end of the game on August 16, another large swastika was displayed. Jewish fans attacked its bearers. As word of the fight spread, reinforcements - including Italian friends of Jewish youths - rushed to the area. The resulting five-hour riot involved baseball bats and iron bars, and spilled onto the streets. Though no one was killed, Torontonians were shocked by the violence.

 The Soldiers' Tower is the University of Toronto's war memorial. A few months after the Armistice ended the First World War on 11 November 1918, the University of Toronto Alumni Association began fundraising to build a memorial tower to honour the alumni, students, faculty and staff who had served and died in the war. The names of the 628 men and women who died while in service are engraved on the Memorial Screen in the west arcade.

The first cemetery, Victoria Square, was located northeast of the current fort and was used from 1794 until 1863. A second cemetery was located further west of here, but closed shortly after opening because the ground was unsuitable. This third cemetery was divided into two sections - Protestants were buried in the north half and Roman Catholics in the south. Most of those interred here died of natural causes typical of the 19th century including various diseases and mishaps like drowning. No complete register of burials has been found, although it is likely there are at least 150 graves here.

That year on June 8 a group of young men broke into the premises, destroyed the press and threw the types into nearby Lake Ontario. The rioters were related by blood or profession to the Province's ruling elite who had been much criticized and ridiculed in the newspaper's columns. This did not excuse their vandalism, but compounded it, in the eyes of those who favoured political reform. Although criminal charges were never laid, a civil court awarded Mackenzie damages sufficient to re-establish his newspaper elsewhere.

291,43.64878,-79.378254,The War of 1812 & the Siege of York,"At 1 King Street West (the white tower on the left), at the elevator lobby on the 30th floor, is this Bruce Bell and Dana King plaque. Here's what it says: The War of 1812 between the United States and Britain, fought partly on Canadian soil and lasting until 1814, is seen today not so much as a war that Britain and Canada won, but as a war where everybody lost. A few people, however, have emerged as legends and are now part of Canadian folklore, like Tecumseh, Isaac Brock, and Laura Secord (and her cow). But for the most part, the War of 1812 was a bloody excess of destruction. By the time the United States had its sights set on York, the British had already seen the death of General Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights the year before. York, however, wasn't strategically important, unlike the towns that bordered the States along the Niagara River. But York was the capital of Upper Canada, after all, and had in its possession a huge stash of weapons, gunpowder, and a massive yet unfinished warship, The Isaac Brock, in the harbour. It was understood whoever held that ship, the biggest ever built, would control the Great Lakes. In 1813, the Town of York had a population of about 600 centered in and around King, Berkeley and Front Streets. It was there that the first Legislative Buildings once stood. At the other end of town was the Garrison at Fort York, still standing, in part, near the grounds of the CNE. In between the town and the Fort were a few farms and the harbour. Back then, the only entrance to the harbour was through its western gap. It wasn't until 1858 that the eastern gap was created when a huge storm carved its way through the peninsula that, until then, curved out into Lake Ontario, thus creating the Toronto Islands. On the morning of April 27, 1813, the tall ships of the U.S. Fleet could be seen entering the harbour: fourteen immense warships with 1700 green uniformed soldiers aboard, sailing past Gibraltar's Point on Toronto Island, hell-bent on attacking not only York, but its very way of life. The war that was being fought miles away was finally coming to town. If you were Loyalist and fled to Canada from the United States, you were here because you didn't want to live in a Democracy, you liked the King of England and his way of governing. None of this 'by the people, for the people' stuff for you. Such was the feeling of many who lived in York: to remain English and never surrender to the Republic that wanted Britain out of the New World forever. This mighty ideal held true to the man who was to become the single most powerful figure in 19th century Toronto, especially after his valiant and widely seen heroic efforts during the capture of York, John Strachan. The winds carried the American fleet, under the command of 34-year-old General Pike, past the Garrison, and made land at the present-day Sunnyside Beach. The soldiers jumped out and waded onto the beach while the two main ships, The President Madison and Oneida, fired their cannons on York. The Battle of York was underway. Three hundred British soldiers, 200 Ojibwa warriors and 300 untrained men and boys of York met the Americans. The Battle of York was to become a blood-soaked disaster for both sides. So, as the Americans advanced on Fort York, British General Sheaffe, in retreat, gave the orders to blow up the ammunition magazine. Seconds later, with the Americans only 366 m away, 227 kg of gunpowder blew sky high. Twenty of our men and 38 of theirs were killed instantly, with another 222 wounded. Dead too was the U.S. commander, Pike. The British also set fire to The Isaac Brock (docked near the present-day Union Station). Since the U.S. didn't capture the ship or seize any of the ammunition (their main goal of this particular campaign) why did they bother to advance on the town of York? It was done in revenge for their losses, and in particular, for the looting that accompanies a town once captured. It's what armies do. The U.S. marched on along present-day Lake Shore Blvd., up to the town's boundary at Front and Peter. The town of York sat in silent but terrified wait. With the fires of the garrison, the burning of The Isaac Brock and the huge explosion still fresh in the residents' minds, the soldiers continued their march along Front, crossed Yonge Street and finally reached the town core itself. At Church and King, they began their looting and pillaging the stores, taking whatever they could carry off. At Jarvis, where the Town Hall stands today, they ransacked the fish and meat shops and gathered up all the whiskey they could drink. All along King Street, no store was left untouched. Furniture, tableware, linens, tobacco, carpenters' tools, surgical instruments, huge amounts of sugar, flour, and soap were emptied from their shelves. The little library (the first in York), the one we were so proud of, was ransacked of all of its books. Houses were burned; jails were thrown open and livestock butchered. A few nights into the occupation, a group of U.S. sailors were seen loitering around the area of King and Berkeley. Moments later the nearby Parliament buildings were on fire and consequently burnt to the ground. Would there be no end to this barbaric intrusion? To be fair, there were some U.S. soldiers who were disgusted with their comrades' actions and stood guard in front of people's houses. As the legend goes, when the soldiers thought they would loot and ransack the then St. James Church, John Strachan said 'Enough!' Dressed head to toe in black, the Reverend of St. James, astride his horse on the steps of his church, demanded that the U.S. forces get out of town and pay, pound for pound, the damage they had inflicted. Amazingly, the U.S. General Dearborn, exhausted from vomiting all week due to seasickness, agreed, helplessly, in front of this imposing figure. The U.S. army withdrew from York, and the legend of John Strachan was created. York was saved from the tyranny of American Democracy. The British way of life was spared for the time being. It would be a long time before the people of York would forget the occupation by U.S. forces. The year after the U.S. burned the Parliament buildings, the British torched their President's home. They painted it white and have called the White House ever since. Losses on both sides were staggering, but it was to be the First Nations who lost the most. Fifteen thousand of this continent's original settlers, more than the combined total of British and U.S. forces, were wasted, and a promise of a permanent homeland (now Upper Michigan) forever vanquished.",Conflict,/Pages/War_of_1812.html

Edward, Prince of Wales, opened the Exhibition and conducted a military review of the thousands of veterans who attended. In 1921, the annual parade became the highlight of the Exhibition's new Warrior's Day (later Warriors' Day).

While there is virtually no evidence of the earlier post, some fortification features associated with it survive because they were incorporated into the later fort. These include the west curtain wall, a dry moat (ditch) and the Government House (or Circular) Battery.Originally, the west wall was a detached earthwork. It was ordered built in 1811 by the Commander of the British Forces in Upper Canada, General Isaac Brock as part of the hardening of British military posts around the Great Lakes just before the War of 1812.Aligned roughly north-south, the wall was laid out at right angle to the shoreline of Toronto Bay. It protected Government House (Lieutenant-Governor's Vice-Regal residence) from a land assault from the west and provided distant protection for the earlier garrison and Town of York located two kilometres east.

At the height of the Battle of York on April 27, 1813, an accidental explosion occurred there when a portable magazine containing artillery ammunition was detonated. The explosion killed 10 men and wounded many others. York's defending troops had fallen back to the Western Battery as the American forces pressed home their attack on the fort and Town of York. Shortly after the accident, the battery was abandoned. Regular army defenders pulled back to the garrison and prepared for withdrawal from the town.

Barker's 50 victories make him the fourth ranking ace in Canada (seventh in the Empire), and his awards for gallantry make him the most decorated serviceman in the history of Canada, the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations.This bronze tribute represents the historic first meeting between these two Canadian heroes. Although the exact date of the meeting is unknown, it is said to have taken place in early 1919 when Barker was recovering in a London hospital from the serious injuries sustained in his historic aerial battle of October 27, 1918, just days before the end of hostilities on November 11, 1918.Bishop and Barker became steadfast friends. They moved to Toronto after the Great War where they began one of North America's first aviation charters called Bishop-Barker Aeroplanes Ltd, operating a fleet of flying boats from Toronto Harbour.

They were in fact, built by the City's newly formed Toronto Civic Railway Company because the privately-owned Toronto Railway Company refused to provide more service to the expanding city territory.From a heritage perspective, the car barns are an excellent example of early 20th century industrial architecture - which was reflected in the surrounding neighbourhoods of Hillcrest, Bracondale and Wychwood Park.

Hippies and teenagers flocked to these unlicensed venues, which offered an alternative to Yonge Street bars.Yorkville was also home to three sound-recording studios, taping major acts such as The Guess Who, Lighthouse, and Anne Murray. With its pivotal role in fostering a wealth of talent, the Yorkville scene inspired a generation of songwriters and led to the rise of a new Canadian sound.

Here's what they say: About 600 years ago, this was the site of a vibrant village of 800 to 1000 people, ancestors of the Huron-Wendat nation. Though their name for this place is lost, their village was discovered under a farmer's field and named the Alexandra site in 2001. In a lengthy excavation, archaeologists revealed evidence of longhouses, sweat lodges, and garbage pits. Nearly 20,000 artifacts were documented and collected from the site before it was developed as a residential subdivision. No human burials were found.Among this site's artifacts were beads made of sea shells from the eastern seaboard - proof that the people here were linked to extensive trading networks. This was also an agricultural community surrounded by cultivated fields of corns, beans, squash, sunflower, and tobacco. Remains of deer, lake trout and wild berries, among other animals and wild plants, indicate that hunting, fishing and gathering also supported the community. The village's location on a small ridge above a waterway (now the altered Highland Creek) provided it with fish and fresh water.Constructed without palisades, the aboriginal village excavated here was probably not threatened by extensive warfare. Its people lived together as extended families in sixteen longhouses, the earliest of which were built at the site's southern edge. Later houses were added to the north, while the older longhouses were frequently rebuilt throughout the site. Likely used to communicate with the spirit world, sweat lodges were social venues which may have helped to form and maintain relationships between newcomers and residents.Over the roughly 40 years of their stay here, the people of this village eventually exhausted the surrounding land of its nutrients and resources. As was their custom, they then moved to another site, leaving this one to return to meadow and forest. Carefully documented, the Alexandra site and its artifacts highlight the long history of human habitation in what is now the City of Toronto.",First Nations,/Pages/Alexandra_Site.html

Here's what the plaques say: In the late 1800s, Aboriginal artifacts, perhaps Huron-Wendat in origin, were found up on the edge of the valley, not far from here. The Huron-Wendat lived for centuries along the waterways flowing into Lake Ontario, including along the Humber River.  The remnants of their villages have often been identified by their distinctive ceramic vessels, tobacco pipes, stone axes, and bone tools, dating to between 1200 and 1580. The Huron-Wendat then moved north to land between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay (still known today as Huronia) to consolidate their communities into a confederacy.  The Huron-Wendat were accomplished traders with extensive networks throughout northeastern North America and beyond. They made contact with the French in 1609, and welcomed the first of many French visitors, Étienne Brûlé, to southern Ontario in 1610.  Approaching a Huron-Wendat village, French travellers encountered well-tended fields of corn, beans, and squash. Agriculture, supplemented by fishing, gathering, and hunting, allowed some Huron-Wendat villages to grow to nearly 2,000 people. Surrounded by fields and situated near rivers or creeks, villages of longhouses were positioned to command a view over the surrounding territory, and were sometimes surrounded by a palisade to protect their inhabitants.Huron-Wendat use of the Carrying Place trail along the Humber River likely became occasional after 1600, as this route was threatened by their enemies, the Five Nations Iroquois. Displaced from their homeland by 1650, many Huron-Wendat moved to the Quebec City area where they remain today. While urban development has since destroyed many of their former village sites on the Humber, traces of these settlements may still be found in the yards and gardens that border the river.",First Nations,/Pages/Huron_Wendat_Villages.html

Inside a palisade, the people of the village dwelt in large multiple family longhouses constructed of slender poles covered with slabs of bark.

",Mississauga Settlements on the Humber River,"This Story Circle, the thirteenth of 13 story circles on the ""Discovery Walks - The Shared Path"", can be found on the west side of the Humber River on Home Smith Park Road, 355 m from Old Mill Road. Here's what the plaques say: When archaeologists in the late 19th century documented remains of Aboriginal occupation on Baby Point (just across the river), they also noted remnants of a settlement on this side of the Humber. The occupants of this site may have been Mississaugas, an Anishinaubeg people and ancestors of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation. In the 1690s, the Mississaugas had moved from the north shore of Lake Huron to their new home in southern Ontario, displacing in the process the Iroquois who inhabited the region and who had built Teiaiagon on Baby Point. The Mississaugas established settlements along the north shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.  Their village here, at the mouth of the Humber River, was on one of the important trade and communications routes linking Lake Ontario to Georgian Bay and the upper Great Lakes.Like other nations before them, the Mississaugas negotiated to their best advantage with the French and British governments who were competing to profit from this area. In August 1759, a few days after the British defeated the French for control of Lake Ontario, Tequakareigh, a leader from the Mississaugas village near the mouth of the Humber, negotiated peace with the British at Fort Niagara on the Niagara River.The British eventually purchased from the Mississaugas much of the land now occupied by the City of Toronto - although some of the terms of that purchase were only finally settled in 2010. The Mississaugas continued to live in this area during the early years of the new Town of York, but then moved west in 1826 to settle at a mission under the leadership of Kahkewaquonaby (Reverend Peter Jones), near the mouth of the Credit River.  In the 1840s, the Mississaugas were again under pressure to relocate. They accepted an offer from the Six Nations of the Grand River to settle on their reserve near Brantford, Ontario, where they have resided since 1847.",First Nations,/Pages/Mississauga_Settlements.html

Here's what it says: You are now near one of Toronto's most studied archeological sites. Around 1450, a large ancestral Huron-Wendat village stood on the rise of land overlooking Black Creek. Almost three hectares in size, the village was twice as large as previous sites, and was occupied during a critical period in ancestral Huron-Wendat history when smaller communities joined to form larger, heavily fortified towns.

Here's what the plaques say: Up on the nearby promontory of land is one of the best-known First Nations archaeological sites in the City of Toronto. Aboriginal peoples likely used this advantageous site for thousands of years, but between circa 1670 and 1688, a Five Nations Iroquois Seneca village was located here.  Its inhabitants called it ""Teiaiagon"". An agricultural village of perhaps 1,000 people, it would have been surrounded by fields of corn, beans, and squash.The Five Nations Iroquois established this and other communities along the north shore of Lake Ontario following their victory over the Huron-Wendat circa 1650. The strategic location of Teiaiagon remains obvious today. It was defended by the steep banks of the point, allowing its occupants to control the southern end of the Carrying Place trail, an important trade route linking Lake Ontario to the upper Great Lakes through Lake Simcoe.We know of this village in part from Europeans who visited it. Father Louis Hennepin and 15 companions found refuge here in 1678 when their ship sought shelter from a storm. In 1680, the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle recorded his stay at Teiaiagon while on his way north. The village was abandoned by the Seneca when they returned to their traditional homeland in what is now New York State. Later, the Mississaugas may have occupied the site as well.  The site of Teiaiagon was first investigated by archaeologists in the 1880s.  Development of the area has consistently resulted in the discovery of artifacts and grave sites.",First Nations,/Pages/Teiaiagon_and_the_Aboriginal_Occupation.html

Accomplished farmers and traders, they occupied numerous villages between AD 1200 and 1600, nearly always along rivers and creeks. They left behind artifacts that included remnants of their distinctive ceramic vessels, tobacco pipes, stone axes and bone tools, all of which help archeologists identify sites as being ancestral Huron-Wendat.

Here's what it says: Between 1450 and 1500, ancestral Huron-Wendat people transformed their village life. Small, unfortified communities merged into larger, more widely spaced villages built on hilltops for defence and surrounded by wall of upright logs. Violent conflict occurred between neighbouring villages, including one along nearby Black Creek father down this trail.After two or three generations, relative peace was secured.

This 1988 Toronto Historical Board plaque giving the details is attached to the outside wall of the school. Here's what the plaque tells us: As long as 4,000 years ago, this sandy knoll was the location of campsites for generations of native people. It provided an excellent lookout over the Don River Valley for observing game. Here small family groups probably lived in skin tents during hunting seasons. Lost for many years, the site was uncovered by workers digging a roadbed in 1886. The discovery aroused great public interest and Ontario's first professional archaeologist, David Boyle, conducted excavations.

398,43.677552,-79.408211,The Baldwin Steps,"These stairs, at the intersection of Spadina Road and Davenport Road, have a plaque at the bottom on the east side which says: Directly below you are the 12,000-year-old shorecliffs of the great glacial Lake Iroquois, formed during the last ice age. Twenty-three metres high, this is the steepest part of the old bluffs running through the city just below St. Clair Avenue. All of Toronto below this point was once under water. An Indian trail connecting the Don and Humber Rivers wound its way along the foot of the hill. This shore line eventually became Davenport Road. These steep bluffs hampered the northward movement of early settlers. But as settlement progressed, much of the shorecliff was tamed and re-graded. A string of fine homes was built along its crest. In spite of these changes, the bluffs retained much of their imposing beauty. In 1913 a stairway was built on the Spadina Road alignment replacing an earlier wooden stairs. In recent times, this site was threatened by a proposal for a Spadina Expressway, with a tunnel beginning just below St. Clair Avenue, and exiting out of this hillside into a sweeping interchange. In 1971, the expressway was halted by the organized efforts of local residents. The Toronto Transit Commission's Spadina subway line was built deep beneath this site in 1980. The land on which the Baldwin Steps are located is now owned by the Province of Ontario and was leased back to the City of Toronto in 1984 for 99 years. The present steps were constructed by the City of Toronto in 1987 and were named to commemorate the Baldwin Family, whose land this once was.",Geology,/Pages/Baldwin_Steps.html

Here's what it says: At the beginning of the last great Ice Age, 120,000 years ago, Toronto lay beneath an ice-sheet more than 2 kilometres high. As the glacier retreated the meltwater created an inland sea, twice as large as present day Lake Ontario, called Lake Iroquois. The lake created a shore bluff between the Don and Humber Rivers, where the coastal waters of Lake Iroquois had a sharper drop-off. Silt and mud washed back into the lake, and sand and gravel formed a beach and spits.As Lake Iroquois drained, first to the south and then through the St. Lawrence river, its water levels fell below those of the present time. This smaller body of water was called Lake Admirality.As Lake Admirality rose to become today's Lake Ontario, the land north of the escarpment was open and rough, while to the south, the beginnings of Toronto merited the name ""Muddy York"".Visit the 5 staircases along the escarpment for great views of Lake Ontario and the city.",Geology,/Pages/Escarpment.html

The building of the bar began with the formation of Lake Ontario about 8,000 years ago. Eroded from the Scarborough Bluffs, the sand was shifted westward by wave action during easterly storms. Eventually a long curving peninsula was formed, creating the large natural harbour on which Toronto was founded. The bar's westward growth was halted shortly after 1858 when a storm opened a large gap near the eastern end of the peninsula. The island thus formed became one of Toronto's major recreational areas.",Geology,/Pages/Toronto_Island.html

The long beach was considered a place of healing and the Mississaugas brought their sick here to recuperate. Early references speak to the healthy atmosphere and the ""peculiarly clear and fine"" air of the peninsula. In addition to its restorative power, the peninsula was used for numerous ceremonial purposes including childbirth and burials.In the 1850s, a series of storms disconnected the body of the peninsula from the mainland and led to the creation of the Toronto Islands as they exist today.",Geology,/Pages/Toronto_Islands.html

Before then, thousands of photographs on glass plates, and boxes of records dating back to 1834, were scattered around the leaky attic. Woadden recognized their historical value and began designing an operation that properly catalogued and preserved them. He introduced centralized records management to City of Toronto department heads, convincing them that records of enduring value should be preserved and transferred to the Archives. When the new City Hall opened in 1965, the Archives moved into the basement and gained much-needed space. Woadden directed the growth of the City of Toronto Archives until he left in 1975 to become the Deputy City Clerk.

412,43.768839,-79.410671,First Fire Hall,"This tall structure stands in Princess Park on the west side of Doris Avenue. A City of Toronto plaque a short distance away tells us about it. Here's what it says: This brick fire hose tower represents a partial reconstruction of North York's first fire hall, which once stood proudly on the east side of Yonge Street near Empress Avenue. It was named in honour of Ivan M. Nelson, who led North York's fire-fighting force after 1935. The original two-bay fire hall was designed by Murray Brown and constructed in 1942. An English trained architect of noteworthy talent, Brown also designed North York's first municipal building in 1923, whose elegant frontspiece and stylized east entrance now stand inside the east vestibule of the Empress Walk development beside this public park. At the time the fire hall was built, the newly-established force consisted of five full-time fire-fighters, two pumper trucks and several volunteers. As North York developed and its population grew, the fire-fighting force expanded and the fire hall was enlarged with an additional bay on its left-side circa 1952, presumably by Brown. Architecturally, the fire-hall was fashioned in the Colonial Revival style incorporating clean lines, contemporary materials and an overall massing influenced by Modern design. Its tower features a gabled roof with cornice returns, pilasters framing a half-circle louvered vent, time clocks, red brick quoins and frieze-like bands of smooth-cut Indiana limestone. Functionally, the design of the structure was influenced by 19th century fire halls, incorporating garage bays, a compact massing and a tower used to hang wet fire hoses. The fire hall was carefully dismantled in 1989. The hose tower was conserved and reintroduced into the public park as an important element interpreting North York's early municipal heritage.",Government Buildings,/Pages/First_Fire_Hall.html

What you are looking at is the frontspiece from the old municipal hall incorporated into a new building on the site. Unfortunately, there is a wall of glass, including the doors, between the outside and this wall making it impossible, because of reflections, to photograph it from the outside. Inside, there is only a couple of metres space between the doors and this wall. So I aimed the camera up and took the shot. All this took place in Princess Park on the west side of Doris Avenue. There is a City of Toronto plaque in the park which talks about the old municipal hall. Here's what it says: This elegant frontspiece once served as the front entrance to North York's first municipal hall which officially opened on December 19, 1923 at the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Empress Avenue. Designed by Murray Brown, a local architect, the building was constructed in response to the formation of North York Township in 1922, and the loss of the temporary offices which once stood at the corner of Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue. In 1946, the municipal hall was enlarged with an addition, incorporating a stylized round-arched entrance with limestone detailing at its east side. Stylistically, Murray Brown based the first municipal hall on North American colonial architecture, incorporating the imagery of civic authority and a design that was considered appropriate to a small municipal government. Brown was also responsible for the design of the municipality's official crest bearing the inscription ""Progress with Economy"". In 1942, he was commissioned by the municipality to design North York's first fire hall, whose fire hose tower has also been reconstructed in the adjacent public park. In 1953, the first municipal hall housed the Magistrate's Court. During the late 1960's, the building was operated by the Emergency Measures Organization and the council chamber served as a courtroom where construction safety law offences were tried. The municipal hall was later used by North York's Parks and Recreation Department until May 1, 1978. Subsequently, the Victorian Order of Nurses took possession of the premises. The municipal hall was carefully dismantled in 1989. Its principal and east entrances were conserved and reintroduced into this development as architectural artifacts that interpret North York's early municipal heritage.",Government Buildings,/Pages/First_Municipal_Building.html

After Toronto annexed Yorkville in 1883, the Yorkville Water Works facility was modified and became the High Level Pumping Station. It was able to pump water up from Lake Ontario to higher parts of the city above the Davenport Ridge.The current complex is the result of several expansions necessary to keep pace with Toronto's growing demand for water. In 1890, the original pump house was converted to a private residence in the Second Empire style. This house still exists and is located to the rear of the complex. In 1906, the City Architect's Office designed the pumping station straight ahead of you in the Edwardian Classical style. Several additions followed.

Here's what it says: There have been four water facilities of different types constructed on Toronto Island on the same site. The first of these consisted of an infiltration basin constructed in 1874. It was about 823 metres long (perimeter 1932 metres) and 4.3 metres deep with a filtration capacity of 20 500 cubic metres per day and a volume of 60 500 cubic metres. The basin was connected to the John Street Pumping Station 3.2 kilometres away on the city side of Toronto Bay by means of a 1200 millimetre wooden pipe across the Island and a 900 millimetre cast iron pipe across the Harbour. Use of this basin was discontinued after about five years when its capacity was reduced by silting and became too small for the increasing population. The second plant was a 182 000 cubic metre per day slow sand filtration plant constructed from 1909 to 1911. This plant continued in service until 1968 and was maintained ready for operation until 1975. Currently, two of its filter basins are used for lagooning filter backwash wastes. The third plant, a Ver Mehr mechanical drifting sand filter plant with a capacity of 273 000 cubic metres per day, was constructed during the First World War and went into service in December, 1917. This plant continued in use for 60 years and was kept ready for operation until 1981. The present plant, a modern, high rate, direct filtration plant, was constructed from 1975 to 1977 and placed in service in April, 1977. It was designed to supply 273 000 cubic metres per day with a design filter rate of 11.7 cubic metres per hour, but included hydraulic spaces for high rating to double that capacity. The plant has been successfully operated at a capacity of 409 000 cubic metres per day. This resulted in decommissioning of the drifting sand plant in 1981 and establishment of a 409 000 cubic metre per day nominal capacity. In 1966 the Island plant was changed from a year-round operation to summer only peak control and operates from about May 1 to October 1 each year.",Government Buildings,/Pages/Island_Filtration_Plant.html

The original plant, designed by engineer Allen Hazen and completed in 1912, was the first water purification facility in the City of Toronto. From 1914 to 1917, a larger plant was built to replace it. Both facilities played a critical role in the reduction of waterborne diseases, including typhoid fever, that killed hundreds of people in the 1880s and 1890s. The filtration plant was guarded during both World Wars to prevent possible sabotage of the city's water supply.The original plant filtered lake water through layers of sand and gravel before piping it to the city through a tunnel under the Toronto harbour. A few of the 1917 buildings are still in use as part of the present water treatment facility, which was built from 1975 to 1977.

R. Mitchell & Co. in October, 1873, for a price of $73,800.00. Construction commenced in late October, 1873, and the reservoir was completed and placed in service by December, 1874, connected to the distribution system by a 61 cm pumping main from John Street Pumping Station, about 8 km away.By 1963, the open reservoir was surrounded by City development and, to protect the water quality and fill a need for added capacity, Metropolitan Toronto decided to deepen, enlarge, and cover it at a cost of $3.4 million. To preserve for the citizens of the area, enjoyment of a body of water in the heart of the City, surface features were added, consisting of a fountain, fountain pool, four acres of reflecting ponds, and a cascade waterfall.

No proposals came forward suggesting new uses that would leave the building intact.In December 1994, the Toronto Raptors Basketball Club announced that a letter of intent had been signed with Canada Post, the owner of the building, with respect to its purchase.

Only a few of those photos appear on this page. Here's what the plaque says: Viljo Revell, the architect of City Hall, did not live to see the opening of this impressive and uniquely designed building. His legacy, however, remains a major architectural accomplishment. Revell's design was viewed by many as representing a break with tradition. Former Mayor Phil Givens claimed that ""new City Hall has provided staid old Toronto with the impetus and architectural inspiration with which to proceed."" Indeed, despite the considerable controversy and debate among architectural traditionalists, this award-winning design represented a step forward in time and was repeatedly described as ""monumental"" and ""expressionistically modern.""Revell's design was the result of an international competition held in 1956 when the original design for City hall - done by a coalition of firms noted for substantial institutional buildings of refined materials but conservative form - was decried as  ""dull and uninteresting"" and ""an inhuman pile of stones"" by architectural students at the University of Toronto. Coverage in the student newspaper, The Varsity, was picked up by Toronto dailies and undoubtedly influenced the Toronto plebiscite in which the proposal was defeated. A new, year-long architectural competition drew 520 entries from 42 countries.Born in 1910 at Vaasa, a town on the west coast of Finland, Viljo Revell studied architecture at the Institute of Technology in Helsinki and opened his practice there in 1935. He also served as assistant to the renowned Finnish architect Alvar Aalto and though he always remained a loyal admirer of Aalto, Revell led the modern nationalist school that developed in Finland after World War II.Decades after the opening of City Hall on September 13, 1965, the building remains a symbol of modern Toronto.

At first, Café Diplomatico served only pastries, gelato, and espresso. The Café quickly became an important community place where newcomers could meet, socialize, and speak Italian; its patio was one of the first in the area at a time when eating and drinking outside was not common in Toronto.As Café Diplomatico grew in popularity, it expanded into the building next door in the 1990s and became an important gathering place for people from across the city.

446,43.640126,-79.420917,The Barrymore Building - 1912,"This double-sided plaque near the southeast corner of King Street West and Atlantic Avenue has this to say about the building: The Barrymore Building at 109 Atlantic Avenue was completed in 1912 for the firm of Gowans, Kent & Company, manufacturers of china and glassware. Throughout its existence the building has accommodated multiple tenants, including such original occupants as hardware merchant Rice, Lewis & Son, and the Page Wire Fence Company. It later housed lingerie maker J. Henry Peters Company and acted as a wool storage depot. For over fifty years, the Barrymore Furniture Company owned and occupied the building as its factory and showroom. It is now listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties and owned by First Capital Realty Inc.Originally, the Barrymore Building sat within a triangle made up of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum to the northeast on Queen Street, the Central Prison to the southeast on Strachan Avenue, and the Mercer Reformatory to the west on King Street West. It was part of a neighbourhood that grew up in the latter half of the 1800s as an area of warehousing and light industry related to the nearby Canadian Pacific Railway and Grand Trunk Railway lines. Until 1909, Hanna Avenue was called Pacific Avenue in reference to the railways.Architecturally, the Barrymore Building is an example of early 20th-century industrial design, consisting of a load-bearing exterior brick envelope and an interior timber structure. Its repetitive window pattern and simple, shallow-arched window construction are typical of this style and era, and of much of the Liberty Street neighbourhood in which it is located. Contextually, the Barrymore Building helps to maintain, define and support the remaining late-19th/early-20th century industrial character of the neighbourhood, as it continues to evolve and adapt to present-day patterns of use.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Barrymore_Building.html
447,43.673434,-79.463462,Canada Cycle & Motor,"Attached to this westbound St. Clair Avenue West transit shelter at Old Weston Road is this City of Toronto plaque. Here's what it says: During the late 1800s, the bicycle went through a major technological advancement. The diamond-shaped frame permitted gear shift and the rear tire, rather than the front tire, to propel the bicycle, which made for a safer ride. Neighbourhood cycling clubs were established and the bicycle repair shop became a fixture in many communities. Canada Cycle & Motor Company (CCM) was an amalgamation of HA Lozier, Goold Bicycle, Welland Vale Manufacturing, Gendron Manufacturing and Massey-Harris in 1899 to fend off an 'invasion' from American Bicycle Company. It became one of Canada's pioneer manufacturing enterprises. CCM's first factory was located in the HA Lozier plant on Weston Road, just north of St. Clair Avenue.During the early 1900s, CCM struggled as it attempted to control the Canadian market. Around World War I, the bicycle became a choice of personal transportation, as rations for fuel were restricted. CCM's 'motor' phase launched when it acquired Canadian Motors Ltd. and produced the first Canadian-made automobile, the Russell, in 1904. During this period, CCM also began to produce skates, and hockey equipment. By the end of World War I, with growth and a diverse range of products sold around the world, CCM relocated to a larger plant in Weston.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Canada_Cycle_and_Motor.html

Here's what it says: This building was the headquarters of the Consumers' Gas Company for 125 years. It was built in stages between 1852 and 1899 on what was one of Toronto's principal financial streets. Architect Joseph Sheard designed the first building at 17 Toronto Street and 24 years later, architect David Brash Dick designed an addition at 19 Toronto Street. In 1899, Dick unified the appearance of the buildings with a Renaissance Revival-style façade that included Corinthian pilasters, ornate windows, and columns made of granite from the Bay of Fundy. The ground-floor hall, decorated with an intricate mosaic floor and brass teller's cages, was a customer service area. Offices were located on the upper floors. The Consumers' Gas Company initially provided Toronto with street lighting; in 1879, it expanded to serve homes and businesses as well. After the Consumers' Gas Company moved in 1977, the structure deteriorated.

457,43.662083,-79.342028,Industrial Dundas-Carlaw,"This Heritage Toronto 2018 plaque can be found in John Chang Neighbourhood Park at 50 Colgate Avenue. Here's what it says: For much of the 20th century, Carlaw Avenue north of Queen Street was the main artery of a busy industrial area. Thousands of people, many of them local residents or streetcar commuters, worked here making a vast array of products, including candy, toys, clothing, furniture, pianos, and rubber goods. This land was occupied by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years, and the marshes to the south were still a notable hunting and fishing territory at the time of colonization. In the 19th century, as the settlement grew, the land was used for brick making and by market gardeners to grow produce for sale in the city. The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) was laid down through the area in the 1850s.In 1906 the makers of Chiclets gum built the first major factory in this area, and others soon followed. The GTR installed freight tracks in 1907, connecting the plant sites to the rail network. Electrical, sewage, and other infrastructure was built to serve the neighbourhood.During the world wars, significantly more women entered the workforce, replacing men serving in the armed forces. The factories also supported the war effort by making items such as bullet tips and military clothing.Starting in the 1960s, as manufacturing declined across North America, factories on Carlaw began to close or move to the suburbs near highways. Many former industrial buildings in this area were altered for small businesses or residences.

Here's what the plaque says: Joseph Bloor (also ""Bloore"") was a prominent landowner, brewer, and philanthropist. Born circa 1789 in Staffordshire, England, he immigrated to the Town of York, now Toronto, in 1819 with his wife, Sarah (née Lees), and their three children.Initially interested in farming in Upper Canada, Bloor instead became an innkeeper, and later established a successful brewery in the Rosedale Valley near today's Sherbourne Street. In about 1836, he and William Botsford Jarvis, another influential landowner, laid out the village of Yorkville on their combined lands. Other names considered for the new village included Cumberland, Bloorville, and Rosedale - the latter being the name of Jarvis' nearby estate.Bloor's contributions to the development of Yorkville were recognized in 1854 when the Concession Road separating the village from Toronto was renamed Bloor Street. He died at his home near this site on August 31, 1862. Originally an Anglican, Bloor converted to Methodism in the late 1830s. In recognition of his generosity towards the Bloor Street Methodist Church, the congregation placed a commemorative stone in the church (since demolished).

Here's what the plaques say: For thousands of years, the Humber River served as a corridor for Aboriginal settlement and trade. In late 1793, only a few months after British officials founded the Town of York (now Toronto), the river began to be converted into a corridor for water-powered industry. Here, within sight of the remains of Aboriginal villages and a French fur-trading post, the British government constructed Toronto's first industrial building - a rough, low shed with a water-powered saw - to supply lumber for government purposes. It became known as ""King's Mill"". Poorly managed and badly maintained, the first King's Mill burned in 1803. Other water-powered sawmills and gristmills (for grinding grains into flour) followed on this site. The last and grandest of them all was constructed circa 1848 as a key part of merchant William Gamble's expanding milling enterprise.Burned in 1881, its stone ruins would become one of Toronto's most romantic landmarks, known as ""the Old Mill"" and a rare visible reminder in the late-20th century of the days of water power.

The seasonal nature of the textile industry meant that workers could socialize and strategize here during slow work periods. The Labor Lyceum also served as an important cultural centre for various Jewish societies and fraternal organizations. It hosted a range of activities from lectures and rallies to dances, plays, and concerts. In the 1940s, the provincial Co-operative Commonwealth Federation held political conventions here.Beginning in the 1950s, the Jewish community moved out of the Spadina Avenue area.

Here's what it says: For more than 130 years, this section of the Don Valley was home to a succession of important paper-making facilities. The first mill to operate here was built in 1858 by John Taylor & Brothers and known as the Middle Mill. It was powered by water from the Don River that was fed into a fast-flowing, man-made channel called a millrace.Operating night and day except on Sundays, the Middle Mill and two other mills nearby, also owned by the Taylors, produced a substantial amount of printing paper. Prominent newspapers, such as The Globe, were printed on paper made from rags and straw at the Taylor mills. The mills also manufactured paper stock for products such as posters, books, and tea filters.In 1907, Robert Davies purchased the Middle Mill and founded the Don Valley Paper Company. Howard Smith Paper Mills took over in 1939, becoming a subsidiary of the Dominion Tar and Chemical Company (later Domtar) in 1961. Due to falling demand, the paper plant closed in 1989.The City of Toronto and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority demolished most of Domtar's factory in 1992, and carried out an extensive clean-up of the land, returning it to its natural state by planting native trees and shrubs.

Here's what it says: After the Union Stockyards relocated from downtown to the southwest corner of St. Clair and Keele, it quickly became one of North America's largest and busiest stockyards and the hub for many meat-related enterprises, which contributed millions of dollars to the economy for 91 years. Traffic on St. Clair Ave. was sometimes disrupted for five to ten minutes at a time as livestock were lead by a Judas cow or goat from the stockyards across the street to the packinghouses.Working in a packinghouse was not easy. The kill floor, where carcasses were dressed out after slaughter, was a male domain in which each worker had a precisely delineated task in the physically strenuous process of disassembly. Female employees worked on packing lines for processed meats, such as sausages and bacon, but they too faced heavy lifting, harsh work environments and a fifty-six hour work week until 1942.In 1944, the Government of Ontario purchased the Union Stock Yards from American interests and renamed it the Ontario Stock Yards.

Until 1945, the majority of livestock sold at the Ontario Stock Yards were transported by rail and while most were slaughtered in the Junction area, some were also shipped out by rail to national and international markets. This attracted meatpacking companies, including Gunns, Swift Canadian, the Harris Abattoir and a variety of industry-related businesses to agglomerate in the vicinity. Rail became an important feature in the urban landscape, as it provided employment, connected distant markets, stimulated engineering and local economy. However, the preference of rail shifted to trucks and highways during the 1950-60s. Local packing businesses shut down in the late 20th century as their location on the outskirts of the City stopped being advantageous.

Railway spurs at the rear connected the factory with the Grand Trunk Railway main line north of here. At its peak during the 1940s and 50s, the Reliable Toy factory included a doll clothing mill, a hairstyling department, and facilities for making shoes, eyes, voice boxes, and squeakers. The Carrie doll and the Reely Ride-em Tractor were among the company's popular products at this time. Reliable was also a leader in plastics technology. During the Second World War, the company made plastic bullet tips, bayonet covers, and oil containers for the armed forces.

Here's what it says: For more than 50 years, this building was the headquarters and main factory of one of the largest graphic arts companies in Canada. Founded in the 1840s as John Ellis & Co., and purchased in 1867 by lithographer Joseph Thomas Rolph, the company was renamed Rolph-Clark-Stone in 1917 after a series of mergers. When the factory opened in 1913, in the heart of a rapidly growing industrial area, the company employed nearly 400 people. They produced high-quality printed materials such as maps, cheques, and certificates. The building's sawtooth roof provided the factory floor with uniform, gentle natural light. A railway line at the rear simplified shipping and receiving. A notable example of industrial architecture from just before the First World War, the Rolph-Clark-Stone building was converted for residential use in 2010.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Rolph_Clark_Stone.html
476,43.727064,-79.292579,"Scarborough's ""Golden Mile""","On Eglinton Avenue East, east of Pharmacy Avenue, amid the retail shops in what used to be an industrial area, is this set of two 2009 Heritage Toronto plaques. Here's what they say: Surrounded by farmland until the 1940s, this stretch of Eglinton Avenue, from Pharmacy Avenue to Birchmount Road, became famous in the 1950s as Scarborough's ""Golden Mile of Industry"" - a hub of large-scale manufacturing and a celebrated symbol of post-war prosperity. The area's transformation began during World War II, when the government of Canada acquired a vast tract of farmland for a munitions plant known as GECo (General Engineering Company). After the war, the Township of Scarborough purchased the plant and additional surrounding land for proposed development. Some of the munitions plant buildings became municipal offices, a Council Chamber, and a public library branch, while other buildings were leased or sold to small businesses.In 1950, ball bearings giant Svenska Kullagerfabriken (SKF) acquired part of the GECo lands and the industrial boom of the Golden Mile began.The Golden Mile promised inexpensive land and low property taxes to industries growing with Canada's post-World War II economic boom. By 1955, corporations such as Frigidaire, the John Inglis Company, Thermos, and Warner Lambert had major manufacturing facilities here. Automobile makers and dealers joined them, including Volkswagen, Rootes Motors, and as late as 1974, a General Motors van plant. Their move to this area provided much needed industrial property taxes, and served as a catalyst for further development. Residential subdivisions sprang up to house the Golden Mile's workforce, followed by strip plazas, which were then celebrated as modern conveniences. By the 1980s, larger industries were moving to less expensive properties, and the Golden Mile of Industry gradually became the Golden Mile of Commerce - known for its large retail stores and car dealerships. However, some industrial buildings do survive - along with street names such as Thermos Road - to remind us of an earlier Golden Mile.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Scarboroughs_Golden_Mile.html

Here's what it says: On this site stood a 19th-century brewery and malt house that, at its peak, produced 26,500 litres of alcohol per week. Established by John Severn in 1835, the brewery specialized in ale and porter to satisfy the tastes of Toronto's British immigrants. Castle Frank Brook (later known as Severn Creek and since buried) was the source of water for Severn's brewery.In the late 19th century, brewing practices improved, and expanded transportation systems allowed breweries to serve a greater area. Although Severn installed a 15-horsepower steam engine to advance his brewery, ultimately his small operation was unable to compete with the region's larger breweries.John Severn died in 1880 and his son, George, inherited the company. Financial difficulties forced the Severn family to close the brewery just six years later.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Severns_Brewery.html

Over the course of the twentieth century, the buildings functioned as the administrative centre and warehouse for the Robert Simpson Co., Simpsons, Simpsons-Sears and Sears Canada mail-order business. Orders were processed and goods sent from this site and from smaller facilities in Regina and Halifax to customers across the country. This section of the complex fronting on Dalhousie Street - an extension of the earlier building behind it - was designed by Frank S. Corley in 1949 in the unadorned International Style.

Here's what it says: For over 100 years, this was a landmark industrial site for the Village of Swansea and the City of Toronto. The Dominion Bolt and Nut Company established a factory adjacent to the railway here in 1882. In 1910, a successor to that company joined four other Canadian steelworks to form the Steel Company of Canada (Stelco). The Stelco Swansea Works continued to produce a wide range of steel fasteners, among other items, before closing in 1990.Stelco and its predecessors were economic anchors for the Village of Swansea. By 1929, when the village numbered about 3,600 residents, the Stelco plant employed about 500 people. The plant also played important social and cultural roles in village life, from housing an early post office to funding sports teams and educational initiatives.The Stelco buildings were demolished in 2003 to make way for the present residential development.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Stelco_Swansea_Works.html

In 1914, at the crest of modern industrialization, the building was designed as Ford's original automobile factory. When Ford relocated in 1925, the building became occupied by several food processing companies. In 1948, Planter's peanuts of Canada purchased the building and                                           operated there until 1987.Plaque Two: When Ford initially constructed the building at 672 Dupont, the company decided to subdivide operations according to floor. For instance, the first floor boasted Ford's spectacular showroom. Here, customers awed at the gleaming Model-Ts which wheeled in before them. On the second floor, warehouse workers loaded and unloaded daily shipments in Ford's massive docking area. Upstairs, assembly line workers earned an honest day's wage by inspecting and assembling auto parts by hand. The paint-shop was located on the building's top floor. Here customers could choose from an array of colours including black, black and black! And finally, on the building's roof, shrieking tires motored around Ford's own test track.

Here's what it says: The Wrigley chewing gum company opened this five-storey factory in 1915. Designed by the architecture firm Prack & Perrine, the building was styled after Wrigleyâs main plant in Chicago, Illinois. A freight track at the rear aided shipping and receiving, and the factory had its own fire hall on nearby Boston Avenue (now a private home). Wrigley made its successful Doublemint, Spearmint, and Juicy Fruit products here for sale in Canada. Technological advances allowed the company to package its gum in airtight wax papers that prevented it drying out and losing its flavour. Wrigley soon added a northern wing to the factory, doubling its size and creating space for lease. Known for its innovative marketing techniques, Wrigley boosted its profile between the wars with neon signs located around Toronto. Amid shortages late in the Second World War, the company stopped selling its most popular products at home and sent them to soldiers instead, creating brand loyalty. Wrigley moved to Don Mills in 1962.",Industrial Buildings,/Pages/Wm_Wrigley_Jr.html

Renamed Smart-Woods after a merger, then Woods Manufacturing in 1918, it became one of the largest producers of fibre products in Canada with factories in Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba. The company also became known for its tents, sleeping bags, and outdoor clothing. At the time, this area was quickly industrializing. Many manufacturing plants opened on Carlaw and Logan Avenues in part due to easy access to the nearby Grand Trunk Railway line. During the world wars, Woods made products vital to the war effort, including tents, hammocks, summer uniforms, and gas mask covers. Its civilian products continued to be popular with outdoor enthusiasts. The Woods complex was split by the extension of Dundas Street East through this area in 1954.

After a move to this site in 1860, a new house of refuge was constructed in 1873, followed by a second building in 1891 dedicated to the care of aged women. By 1908 elderly men were also taken in and Belmont House was built to provide facilities for even greater numbers of both men and women. The house of refuge closed in 1939 and the institution devoted itself thereafter to the care of the elderly. The three old houses were demolished in 1966 and the present Belmont House was opened in 1969 by his Excellency The Rt. Hon. Roland Michener, Governor-General Of Canada.

Here's what it says: The Don Jail is one of Toronto's most important mid-nineteenth-century public buildings. Located on a hill then outside City boundaries, it was constructed with exacting craftsmanship according to plans of William Thomas, Toronto architect and designer of other landmarks such as St. Lawrence Hall and St. Michael's Cathedral. Even though some cells measured only 1 by 3 metres, the Don Jail embodied progressive ideas of penal reform. It was once the largest prison of its kind in North America, and included a farm (now largely Riverdale Park) worked by prisoners. The building's Renaissance Revival style made jail appear suitably intimidating. Seventy executions took place on its gallows, including the last in Canada on December 11, 1962. After 113 years, the old Don Jail building was closed as a prison in 1977 - the east wing, completed in 1958, continued to serve as the Toronto Jail.",Institutional Buildings,/Pages/Don_Jail.html

490,43.66648,-79.354218,The Exercise Yards at the Don Jail,"Here on the Bridgepoint Hospital site on the south side of a pedestrian walkway (Bridgepoint Drive), north of the old Don Jail can be found this plaque. Here's what it says: The area behind the Don Jail was once divided into three exercise yards for inmates. In this 1956 photograph, the exercise yards are behind the brick wall on the right.Before penal reform in the 19th century, people believed that prisons were only for punishment. Many prisons placed inmates in overcrowded cells and rarely let them outdoors. Penal reformers maintained that incarceration was not just an instrument of punishment, but also a chance to prepare convicts for going back into society. They believed that inmates should lead balanced lives that included fresh air, work, and education.Overlooking the Don River Valley and surrounded by fields and woodland, the location of the Don Jail was considered to be a healthy moral and physical environment for inmates. The property included a hospital, residences, and a farm. The farm grew oats, potatoes, carrots, and peas. The inmates raised chickens, turkeys, sheep, and pigs. Researchers have found signs of an old well and cistern, which would have been used to supply the jail with water. A large skylight and rotunda brought sunlight into the centre of the building and reduced the need for artificial light. The original skylight was removed around 1960. The present skylight is a reconstruction based on the 1956 photograph displayed here.Allowing inmates out of doors meant there was a risk of escape attempts. The so-called Polka Dot Gang once overpowered two guards and formed a human pyramid to try to mount the yard wall. More security soon arrived and defeated the attempt.  A guard room was eventually installed to monitor inmates through slim, horizontal rifle windows. These windows are on the ground floor of the west tower.Although the Don Jail was progressive in some respects, part of its role was to carry out the death penalty. In 2007, archaeologists found that 15 people were executed and buried in the east exercise yard. After the archaeologists studied and documented the area, the human remains were re-interred in St. James Cemetery, Toronto. The area where the graves were is outlined in paving stone.",Institutional Buildings,/Pages/Exercise_Yards.html
491,43.665277,-79.353883,The Gate House at the Don Jail,"Here on the Bridgepoint Hospital site at the Gate House on Gerrard Street, west of Broadview Avenue, can be found this plaque. Here's what it says: The gate house marked the entry to the Don Jail on the east side of the driveway. Wooden gateposts mark the west side. At one time, a wooden fence surrounded the entire site. This was to keep inmates working on the jail's farm from escaping.The gate house was completed in 1865. At first, it was a modest, one-storey structure that served as the post for the jail's Gatekeeper. It is unclear whether the Gatekeeper was a permanent position. It may have been a role held by various turnkeys or head guards. The turnkeys controlled access to the property and to different parts of the jail. They lived in cottages near the jail's east wing.A few years after the jail opened, a Deputy Governor was hired to assist the governor. The gate house became the Deputy Governor's residence. By 1879, an addition was built in the Second Empire style, notable for its mansard roof. It gives the building a modest, domestic appearance, in contrast to the forbidding grandeur of the jail.In 2012, the Phillip Aziz Centre renovated the house for use as the administrative offices of Emily's House.",Institutional Buildings,/Pages/Gate_House.html

Here's what it says: George L. Allen was the first governor of the Don Jail. At first, the governor lived in an administrative wing of the jail itself.In 1888, architect Charles Mancel Willmot (1855-1936) renovated the jail to create more cells, infirmary space, and laundry facilities. He designed a separate family residence at 562 Gerrard Street East for the governor at the time, John Green. It was designed in the Queen Anne Revival style. This style is characterized by its asymmetrical façade, cross-gable roof, decorative brick patterns, and simple Victorian woodwork.This house remained a residence until 1973. After that, the Ministry of Correctional Services used it to administer programs. It became the Toronto offices of the John Howard Society, which advocates for justice in the prison system and provides support services to people in conflict with the law.In 2012 the house was renovated by the Phillip Aziz Centre.

This fine Neo-Classical building constructed of sandstone, a landmark in South Riverdale since its opening in 1913 as Postal Station 'G'. It was designed by E.J. Lennox.

The Clock

In 1995 the Ralph Thornton Centre Board of Management undertook a special fundraising campaign to restore the clock, giving back to the local community, and to Queen Street commuters, their historic time piece which had been still since 1979. This is a flat bed turret clock with pinwheel escapement, designed by Joyce and Co. of Whitchurch, U.K. and built by Smiths of Surrey, U.K. in 1913. Restored in 1995 by Lloyd Hovey of Toronto through the generosity of the Tennison family in the memory of Mr. Arthur Tennison who was the head Stone Mason in the construction of this building.

Town Hall and Cultural Centre

During its first 63 years the ""Old Post Office"" made the upper floors available for various community purposes from time to time. Woodgreen Community Centre got its start here with a boxing ring on the top floor. In 1979 Toronto City Council established the South Riverdale Neighbourhood Improvement Project, which recommended that the building be acquired as a multi-purpose community facility, to include the Queen-Salter Library and the South Riverdale Child Parent Centre. In 1980 Toronto City Council signed a 20 year lease with the Federal Government for the ""Old Post Office"" and adopted a By-law establishing a community centre to be operated by a Board of Management elected by the community at an annual general meeting. The official opening was held on Valentine's Day in 1981. It is the indispensable meeting place for almost every organization in the South Riverdale area and the catalytic incubating ground for innumerable new efforts at community betterment.

Here's what they say: Once one of the city's largest centres of charity, the House of Providence stood nearby for over 100 years. It was initiated by Toronto's Roman Catholic Bishop, Armand-François-Marie de Charbonnel, in response to the plight of the desperately poor, including many Irish immigrants. To provide shelter and food for those most in need, de Charbonnel enlisted both the help of the Sisters of St. Joseph and the generosity of the surrounding community. Operated by the Sisters, the House of Providence opened in 1857. Nearly always filled to capacity, the House of Providence would eventually quadruple in size to provide for about 700 residents, including the elderly, the unemployed, orphans, widows, and newcomers to Canada. Some stayed only a few days; others, for years. At its doors, daily meals were given out to the hungry, particularly during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The House of Providence was demolished in 1962 to make way for the Richmond Street exit from the Don Valley Parkway. It was by then a home for the aged, and its residents moved with the sisters of St. Joseph to Providence Villa and Hospital, a new facility located at St. Clair and Warden Avenues, and known today as Providence Healthcare.",Institutional Buildings,/Pages/House_of_Providence.html

Here's what it says: The early town of York sat on the lakeshore just a few kilometres to the southwest of these grounds. It was established in 1793 by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe hope to attract settlers to York from England and the United States. He offered 81 ha land grants to those who agreed to take an oath of loyalty to the King of England. These lots extended from Lot Street (now Queen) north to Bloor, and from the Don River to the Humber River.This site includes some of the property that Simcoe granted to his own estate manager, John Scadding, in 1796. Scadding built three houses on the land over the years. One of these - the oldest surviving house in Toronto - was moved in 1879 to the Canadian National Exhibition grounds, where it remains today.After Scadding's death in 1824, the family kept the property here and purchased more adjoining land. In 1856, the Town of York became the rapidly growing City of Toronto. City Council, in need of land to build a new hospice and jail, allocated £14,000 to buy about 50 ha of the Scadding land.Plans begin right away for the House of Refuge, a hospice for the ""poor, needy, and disabled,"" and the Toronto (Don) jail, a progressive ""reform"" jail. These two facilities would soon operate together as a self-sufficient compound. There were residences for the staff and a working farm.

Their locations are shown on the first plaque above numbered 1 to 8 (a self-guided tour with audio description is available at 416-535-8501 ext. 31530). You can also see them all further down this page. Here's what this plaque says: These patient-built walls are a testament to the abilities of the people whose unpaid labour was central to the operation of asylums in the Province of Ontario during the 19th and 20th centuries. The asylum on Queen Street first opened in 1850 and was overcrowded within a few years. The initial idea of work as therapy gave way to the reality of work intended to save the provincial government money through unpaid patient labour. Men worked outdoors on construction, maintenance and farm work, including building and repairing many of the structures behind which they were confined, including the still-existing boundary walls on the south side of this property, built in 1860, and the east and west boundary walls built in 1888-89. Women worked primarily inside, doing the sewing, knitting and laundry for the asylum, while also working as domestic servants in both the nurses' and doctors' residences not far from this spot. Both men and women also worked in their own sex-segregated wards doing domestic chores such as cleaning, washing and scrubbing floors. Patients also worked in the male (west side) and female (east side) infirmaries, where they helped to care for those of their fellow patients who were sick and dying. Seen by many as the physical representation of prejudiced attitudes towards people with a psychiatric diagnosis, the walls which still stand today are historical monuments to the exploited labour of all psychiatric patients who lived, worked and died on these grounds since 1850.Presented by the Psychiatric Survivor Archives of Toronto, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Friends of the CAMH Archives, and many other donors.

Here's what the set of two plaques on the south side of the sculpture say: Where you are standing was once the commercial centre of the Town of York, Toronto's forerunner. It is part of a 2.2 ha site which was officially dedicated as a market in 1803. The area, now bounded by King, Jarvis, Front and Church streets, was an uneven parcel of land with a small stream running diagonally across it. The ten original blocks of the Town of York are located just to the east of here.The first market building, an 8 m by 12 m, single-storey wooden structure, was built in 1814. Held every Saturday, the market was the only place farmers could sell their produce to Town residents. Water was needed for the market, so, the Town's first public well was dug near here in 1823. As the early focus of business and social activity in the community, the market often became the setting for civic activities and functions. Public punishment of criminals also took place here.

From 1886 to 1995, two different Headquarters buildings stood here. The first was noted for its grand auditorium and for its imposing façade marked by battlements. That building was demolished and replaced by one designed by architectural firm John B. Parkin Associates. Opened in 1956, this was one of Toronto's first modern office buildings, and was considered to have 'set the pace in downtown Toronto for style for many years to come'. In 1995, The Salvation Army relocated its Territorial Headquarters, and the second building was also demolished to make way for expansion of the Toronto Eaton Centre. Along with administrative offices, the Headquarters buildings also housed Toronto Temple (church). For over 100 years, Sunday worship services, revival meetings, and social service programs for those in need brought people to this corner. For that reason, this square was officially named ""Salvation Square"" in 1987.",Institutional Buildings,/Pages/Salvation_Army_Territorial_Headquarters.html

The first market buildings were destroyed by fire in 1860, and were replaced in 1873 by a grander St. Andrew's Hall and Market designed in Renaissance Revival style. The buildings housed everyone from sellers of fresh produce to butchers, as well as a police station, a community hall, and a public library branch. St. Andrew's Market began a gradual decline in the 1870s. Despite an impressive 1889 addition, the market stalls were largely empty by 1900. The buildings were demolished in 1932 and replaced by the present Water Works building. Used as a public park since the 1880s, this southern section became St. Andrew's Playground in 1909.

One of the first events in the newly-renovated St. Lawrence Hall was the 1851 ""North American Convention of Colored Freemen"". Anti-slavery feelings ran high in Toronto after the United States government passed the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850. Now escaped slaves and even free African Americans could be arrested without warrant or trial anywhere in the United States.

Fifty-three delegates from across Canada and the Unites States, plus one from the Caribbean, attended the three-day convention. Prominent abolitionist leaders including Dr. Martin Delany, Thomas Smallwood and John Cary debated issues of importance to the North American Black community. Topics included discussion of how to advance the fight against slavery and the effects of the Fugitive Slave Law, the fight against segregated schooling for Black children and the difficult question of whether or not to encourage Blacks to emigrate from the United States and build new lives in Canada, the Caribbean, or Africa.

Here's what they say: Though now away from the lake and nestled among the trees, this is the oldest surviving lighthouse on the Great Lakes and the second oldest surviving lighthouse in Canada. It was constructed in 1808-09 when this site was only eight metres from the shifting shoreline of Lake Ontario and exposed to violent lake storms. Guiding sailors into York (now Toronto) harbour, this lighthouse was also used to hoist flags signalling the approach of ships to the town and fort. At a time when most buildings in York were built with local materials, the lighthouse was constructed of stone from Queenston, near Niagara Falls. Its walls are almost two metres thick at the base, and were raised to their existing height by adding stone from Kingston in 1832. Its wick lamps, which were visible many kilometres out over the lake, were fuelled with hundreds of litres of whale oil per year, then coal oil, until an electric light was installed in 1917. In 1809, the lighthouse was the only major light on York's dark, forested horizon. In 1945, the light was changed from white to green to distinguish it from the bright lights of the modern city. The Gibraltar Point Lighthouse was once accompanied by the whitewashed clapboard homes of the lighthouse keepers, the first civilian residents on the island. The third and fourth keepers, James Durnan and his son George, maintained the wick lamps and the lighthouse from 1832 to 1905. After 1878 George also rewound - every 48 hours - the new mechanism which revolved the light. Over time, the keepers and their families formed the nucleus of a growing island community. At the end of the 1957 shipping season, the light of the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse was extinguished for the last time by Dedie Dodds, the last of the keepers. After nearly 150 years of service, the stone lighthouse was replaced by the federal Department of Transport with a fully automated, modern skeletal tower. The ownership of the old lighthouse was transferred to Metropolitan Toronto Parks Department in 1958. The Gibraltar Point Lighthouse has since been restored, the remaining homes of the lighthouse keepers demolished, and the surrounding land integrated into Toronto Island Park.",Marine Buildings,/Pages/Gibraltar_Point_Lighthouse.html

Because of its unique status as the oldest structure still on the waterfront, the building avoided demolition in the early 1980s, although it had to be relocated yet again, a few metres west to make room for developments on York Quay. Then in 1988, it was moved to its current location at the foot of York Street, where it served as a waterfront information centre for several years. Over its lifespan the building has also been a water gauge used to measure lake levels, a storage house for stage props, a vehicle garage, an office, a restaurant and a cafe. It has survived several relocations, vandalism, and a fire in 1918 that destroyed an adjacent ferry terminal. It is the only remaining example of Toronto's waterfront architecture from the turn of the 20th century.",Marine Buildings,/Pages/History_of_the_Pier_6_Building.html

Here's what it says: This lighthouse, one of the earliest on the Great Lakes, was completed in 1808 as an hexagonal tower 16 m high, topped by a wooden cage with a fixed whale-oil lantern. In 1832 it was raised to 25 m and later equipped with a revolving light. The mysterious disappearance of its first keeper, J.P. Rademuller, in 1815 and the subsequent discovery nearby of part of a human skeleton enhanced its reputation as a haunted building.",Marine Buildings,/Pages/Lake_Light.html
527,43.639767,-79.38013,Pier 6,"On Queens Quay West across from York Street on the outside of the Pier 6 building is a Toronto Harbour Commission plaque. Here's what it says: Pier 6 is the oldest surviving building on Toronto's present waterfront. Its steep roof and deep eaves, cargo doors, and classical detailing are characteristic of the port's freight sheds around the turn of the century. Built in 1907 as part of a ferry terminal complex near the corner of Yonge Street and Lake Shore Boulevard, it was cut in half and relocated to the York Street slip in 1922 soon after the original site was reclaimed. It then served as a shed and garage until 1953, when it was refurbished to become the Royal Canadian Yacht Club's shore station. Development pressures during the 1980's included plans to fill the north end of the York Street slip, and to remove the building. As a result of a joint effort by the Toronto Harbour Commission and the City of Toronto, the historic building was relocated to its newly reclaimed site in the spring of 1989. Completed in 1990, its renovation preserved a unique style of Toronto's waterfront architecture while accommodating a wide range of modern uses.",Marine Buildings,/Pages/Pier_6.html
528,43.636098,-79.405385,Queen's Wharf Lighthouse,"This lighthouse can be found on the small strip of green space on Fleet Street, just east of Fort York Boulevard. So what's it doing so far from the water, I hear you asking? To find out, let's read the 2012 Heritage Toronto plaque just to the west of the lighthouse. Here's what it says: Now landlocked on Fleet Street, this lighthouse once stood on the Queen's Wharf. The wharf - originally known as New Pier - was built in 1833 to stimulate commercial activity in the west part of the harbour.This lighthouse, constructed in 1861 on the north side of the west extension, was the second built for the Queen's Wharf. Noted architect Kivas Tully, later architect of the Ontario Department of Public Works, designed its octagonal plan for what became, in 1911, the Toronto Harbour Commission. The Queen's Wharf Lighthouse, along with a lighthouse farther west on the pier, guided ships safely into the western harbour.Beginning in the 1880s, the area west of Queen's Wharf was filled in with lake dredging. The old channel into the harbour could not be maintained and, in 1911, the lighthouse was decommissioned. In 1929, the Toronto Harbour Commission transferred ownership of the lighthouse to the City of Toronto. The lighthouse was moved to its present site later that year.",Marine Buildings,/Pages/Queens_Wharf_Lighthouse.html
529,43.659159,-79.403537,A Brief History,"This plaque, a brief history of Kensington Hospice, can be found in front of 38 Major Street, north of College Street. Here's what it says: For well over a hundred years this building has been associated with delivering health care services to the community.It was originally built in 1892 as a convent and chapel by the Anglican sisters of St. John the Divine who in 1889, had opened the ""St. John's Surgical Hospital for Women"" next door to it. Under their auspices, that hospital became a general hospital in the 1920's and, after 1937, it provided accommodation, shelter, and respite care until it and the chapel were sold in 1951. The interior ceiling of the chapel was later declared to be of historical significance and has been preserved to this day.In the 1950's, four brothers who had committed themselves to practicing in the community where they grew up, acquired this building from the sisters along with the adjacent buildings and properties and constructed a modern, full scale, 319-bed acute care hospital, the ""Doctors Hospital"".The Raxien brothers -- Dr. Sam Raxien (dentist), Dr. Alex Raxien (surgeon), Dr. Ben Raxien (anesthesiologist) and Dr. Saul Raxien (family practitioner) -- also constructed an office building for doctors, dentists and other professionals at 25 Brunswick Avenue. Many of the tenants there joined the staff of Doctors Hospital or supplied services to its patients.This building was connected by a corridor to the first floor of the Doctors Hospital and the chapel area served as an auditorium for medical and nursing staff meetings, medical lectures and presentations, intern and other training seminars, and general meetings involving health care and community issues.The community, which then stretched from Bloor Street to the north and the Kensington Market area to the south, was one of the main areas where newcomers to Canada and Toronto first settled. Predominantly a working and middle class neighbourhood, it hosted wave after wave of immigrants from England, Ireland, Middle and Eastern Europe, Russia, Italy, Portugal, China, Vietnam and other eastern and Asian countries, to name but a few. Consequently, this area was always alive and bustling with the sounds and sights of different languages and customs.At the heart of the philosophy of the four founders of the Doctors Hospital was a commitment to accommodate as many of the cultures in the community as possible and to provide a multi-faith and ethnic-appropriate approach to patient care, while being an innovative, leading edge provider of modern health care services on a not-for-profit basis.Unlike other public hospitals at the time, no restrictions were placed on visiting times, recognizing that many in the community worked outside normal working hours; overnight visits were permitted to comfort patients unaccustomed to hospital stays; ethnic food was provided or could be brought in by family members; doctors and staff could converse with patients in their own languages and translators were on staff for cases where they could not. The Doctors Hospital rightfully boasted that it was the hospital ""where more than 40 languages are spoken"".In 1969, the remaining Raxlen brothers retired and the Doctors Hospital became a publicly owned hospital. It continued to carry on and expand its services in the tradition of its founders, but when the Ontario government decided to reduce the number of active care hospitals in the province, it was forced to close its doors in 1998.Subsequently, Doctors Hospital changed its name to ""The Kensington Health Centre"" and commenced a new era in the delivery of not-for-profit health care.The Kensington Health Centre, with the assistance of the Kensington Foundation, carried out the demolition of the hospital tower and the office building on Brunswick Avenue. In their place, two modern long term care facilities were built as well as various state-of-the-art ambulatory patient services in the College Street clinical building, including the Kensington Eye Institute and the Kensington Cancer Screening Centre.This building was eventually renovated with the help of private donations to house a palliative care residential hospice that opened in August, 2011.All are accessible to the community and the province at large.Inspired by the commitment of the Raxien brothers and in particular, the vision and ambition of Dr. Sam Raxien, the first President and CEO of Doctors Hospital, as well as the innovative and forward thinking of Brian McFarlane, the first president and CEO of the Kensington Health Centre, this hospice will continue the philosophy of health care that they fostered.By providing compassionate, supportive, non-denominational, and responsive end of life care for residents, family members and friends who come here from all backgrounds, cultures, religions and means, the legacy of all who have contributed to this history will be ensured.",Medical Buildings,/Pages/Brief_History.html

Here's what it says: Central Hospital was founded in 1957 in a house at 331 Sherbourne Street which had been built in 1875 for Robert T. Gooderham. The property was purchased in 1921 by the Canadian National Institute For The Blind (established in 1918) for use as a women's residence. The ""Clarkewood Residence"" moved to Bayview Avenue when the CNIB consolidated its operations there in 1956. The property was then purchased by doctors Paul and John Rekai, who had immigrated to Toronto from Hungary in 1950. In May 1957 they opened a 32 bed private hospital with a multilingual staff committed to providing health care to people of diverse cultural backgrounds. Their success led to the replacement of the Gooderham House with a new 176 bed public hospital that was opened in September 1969.",Medical Buildings,/Pages/Central_Hospital.html
531,43.660646,-79.387057,The College Gates,"These gates have travelled here, there and almost everywhere in their 130 years of existence (as of 2018). A College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario plaque attached to the gates here at 80 College Street tells the story of their journeys: These wrought iron lock-up gates were purchased by the College in 1888 for the main entrance to its newly constructed offices at 371 Bay Street, located on the south east corner of Bay and Richmond Streets in Toronto. They are the only remaining artifacts from the building which served as the College's home until 1905. The manufacturer was J.H. Pendrick who was contracted for a sum of $420 (whether this included other work is not known). The gates would have folded open to the side during the day and closed at night to discourage loitering or sleeping in the entranceway. When the building was demolished in 1960, Mr Warwick Noble, College solicitor and son of the former Registrar, Dr Robert T. Noble, rescued the gates and brought them to his country home near Norval, Ontario. The following year he suggested that they be used in the construction of the College's new building at 64 Prince Arthur. The Registrar, Dr Dawson, agreed, and had two sections lengthened in order to be mounted at the entrance to the parking lot. When the College moved to its present location in 1983, the gates were purchased by Stan Burr, a College staff member, who kept them for many years at his property in Durham. Mr Burr believed the gates should once again belong to the College and so returned them on his retirement in 1999.",Medical Buildings,/Pages/College_Gates.html

Here's what it tells us: This site, which is now home to Bridgepoint Active Healthcare, has a long history of addressing Toronto's most pressing social and healthcare issues.In 1856, the City of Toronto purchased this land from the Scadding family. The city immediately began plans for a new jail and house of refuge. The site was then outside of the city, surrounded by forests and fields. It was beside the Don River, which was considered an excellent setting to promote moral and physical health.The city built the House of Refuge in 1860 to care for the ""poor, needy, and disabled."" Then in 1872, an outbreak of smallpox meant that patients had to be treated in isolation. The House of Refuge shifted its focus to caring for them. By 1891 the facility was also caring for people with other contagious diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and scarlet fever. It became known as the Isolation Hospital. A brand new facility was built in 1893, and by 1904 it was known as Riverdale Isolation Hospital.Over the next 50 years the facility kept changing to meet the needs of the community. It created a training school for nurses in 1894. New buildings with more beds were built in 1911. A measles ward was built in 1927.Renamed Riverdale Hospital in 1957, the care mandate was expanded to include chronic illnesses and rehabilitation services. It specialized in orthopedics, surgery, oncology, neurotrauma, amputees, post-cardiac patients, and palliative care.Today, Bridgepoint Active Healthcare is a global leader in research and treatment of complex health conditions and rehabilitation.

The Hospital For Sick Children vacated the building in 1951. It was used as office space and, on occasion, as a location for film projects. For a decade it stood empty. In 1991, through funds from the Province of Ontario, work was begun to retain and restore historical elements of the building and to adapt it for use as the Canadian Red Cross regional blood centre for Toronto and central Ontario.

Interesting stuff! Here are the plaque details: When the military hospital closed after the War of 1812, York was left without a hospital. Surplus funds raised by the 'Loyal and Patriotic Society of Upper Canada' for those who suffered as a result of the war, were used to build a hospital at the northwest corner of King and John Streets. A two story red brick building for 100 patients was completed by 1824, but was immediately requisitioned for the Legislative Assembly, whose building had been destroyed by fire. It was opened as a hospital in 1829, and became the Toronto General Hospital in 1834. From 1831, Dr. John Rolph used the hospital for teaching medical students, and students from King's College and Trinity College were also taught here. During the Cholera Epidemic of 1847 wooden sheds were built to the north and it became a fever hospital, accommodating 798 patients.",Medical Buildings,/Pages/York_Hospital_Site.html

Dr. Norman Allen, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, wrote to the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1891, asking for help. The sisters sent six nuns to care for the ill at the Isolation Hospital. By 1894, the hospital had established a training school for nurses. In 1922, Riverdale Isolation Hospital became the University of Toronto's teaching centre for the treatment of communicable diseases. It was supervised by Dr. Beverly Hannah. A nurses' residence was soon built to support this important program. In 1945 the hospital's South Building was renovated and renamed the Hannah Building. Between 1910 and 1929, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Charles Hastings brought about many health reforms in Toronto. He helped reduce the spread of disease by creating policy for public vaccination. He spearheaded legislation to pasteurize milk and chlorinate drinking water.

Here's what it says: The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (PVBIA) encompasses the area along Toronto's celebrated Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. Because of its close proximity to the waterfront, Parkdale was once a resort spot for Torontonians - with beautiful summer homes nestled among lush trees and plants. As Toronto blossomed into Canada's greatest city, Parkdale grew alongside it - transforming from a quaint beach-side community to the vibrant and bustling urban area we know and love today. This development has had immeasurable benefits for Parkdale; although sadly the transformation cost us many of our beautiful trees. The PVBIA, working in conjunction with local businesses, community members and proudly supported by TD Green Streets, aims to reverse this damage by planting trees and greenery within our neighbourhood, such as in these urban garden plots located at the northern corners of Brock Avenue and Queen Street West.Originally, this land was covered in forests of sugar maples, beech, yellow birch, white ash and hemlock. The name Parkdale, fixed upon in the 1870s, was meant to convey images of decorative gardens and fertile country-side.In 1812, 97 ha of land surrounding Lot Street (now known as Queen) between Jameson and Dufferin Avenues were granted to James Brock for his military service. Upon Brock's death, his widow Lucy Brock commissioned a roadway along the centre-line of the length of the lot parcel. This road, built in 1850, is today known as Brock Avenue.In 1852, writer W.H. Smith described Brock Street as ""a cluster of houses, three of which are taverns"".

The plaque is along the west side of the lot. HistoryScouts camped in this valley, with permission of the owners, in the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1936, approximately 40 ha were purchased by the Toronto District of The Boy Scouts Association from the Lennox family who were farmers in the area. Only 24 km from Toronto and featuring hills, valleys, woods, a creek and abundant wildlife, it was an ideal spot for day hikes, short-term camps, camporees, training courses, group meetings, corn and wiener roasts and cuborees.The name ""Camp of the Crooked Creek"" was selected through a competition open to Toronto Scouting youth. In the early years there was no road into the valley and consequently everything - tents, equipment, food and packs - had to be carried down the hill and, at the end of the camp, carried back up again.In 1963, approximately 20 ha of the north end, bordering on Ellesmere Road, was sold for the construction of Scarborough Centenary Hospital. Scouting continued to use the remainder of the property until 1968 when it was taken over by The Metropolitan Toronto Conservation Authority.Over the thirty-two years that Camp of the Crooked Creek operated, it is estimated that camper days (one camper for one day) totalled about 750,000. Thousands of Cubs and Scouts lit their first camp fire, cooked their first camp meal, spent their first night under the stars and learned their first woodcraft skills.The camp was used year-round and many will remember their first experience of winter camping.Gilwell LodgeHalf hidden in the woods on the north side of a large, level, grassy area near the south end of the property was Gilwell Lodge, a 6 m by 12 m frame structure with a stone fireplace and a kitchen area with a wood burning cook stove. This area was used for leadership training. Hundred of adults attended training courses in this area where they learned Scouting programming and outdoor skills to pass on to their young members.During World War II, this area was used for ""Camp Victory"". This was a camp for Scouts whose leaders were serving in the armed forces and thus could not take part in their own troop camp.Campfire pavillionBuilt in the trees near the bottom of the hill, just south of what is now Campfire Pit 8, was a 15 m by 15 m wooden platform with built-in benches around the perimeter and a large stone pillar fireplace with a steel smoke canopy in the centre. Many happy campfires were held here with singing, skits and marshmallow toasting.ChapelJust below the top of the hill on the west side near what is now Plover Road, was a rustic outdoor chapel with a log altar and log seats. Each Sunday, ""Scouts Own"" was held, which was a non-denominational worship service, planned and conducted by Scouts. Occasionally, a camping troop would arrange for their own chaplain to come and conduct a service. The chapel was also used on occasion for investitures of new Cubs, Scouts, Rovers and/or leaders.Swimming HoleEach year, the creek was dammed to create a swimming hole. As anyone with knowledge of this valley will know, the creek bed is very unstable. The result was that often during a heavy rain storm, the dam washed out and it took several days to repair. However, thousands of Scouts recall happily splashing in the swimming hole.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Camp_of_the_Crooked_Creek.html

In 1949, he was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as the country's outstanding athlete and, in 1976, was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Lumsdon was inducted into the Order of Canada in 1982. Throughout his long career, Lumsdon received most of his swimming instruction from the legendary coach Gus Ryder. Lumsdon later went on to coach his daughter, Kim Lumsdon, who successfully crossed Lake Ontario on August 27, 1976. On March 1, 1988, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto dedicated this park in recognition of Cliff Lumsdon's many outstanding achievements and his lifelong contribution to the community. He passed away August 31, 1991.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Cliff_Lumsdon_Park.html
607,43.65123,-79.379852,Cloud Gardens Early History,"Cloud Gardens, between Richmond Street West and Temperance Street a half a block west of Yonge Street, contains several plaques. The historical one, ""Early History"" is located on a post in the shade of some trees. It has this to say: The park site is on land originally subdivided for building lots by Jesse Ketchum (1782-1867) who owned the land from north of King up to Queen between Yonge and Bay. A Methodist and strong promotor of Christian ways, Temperance Street was named by Mr. Ketchum. Leases to the lots on his land included a unique caveat that allows him to prohibit ""nauseous or offensive"" uses. This early land use control was used to limit hotels that used alcohol and to promote Christian institutions which were established on Temperance Street. In addition to his gift of land for Jesse Ketchum School and Jesse Ketchum Park in Yorkville, Mr. Ketchum donated the land for Knox Church, which once occupied a site to the north of this park. The Richmond Street Methodist Church occupied a site to the west of the park. The name and date stone that was above the front door of the Methodist church [Wesleyan A. D. 1844] has been placed in the park garden. In the 19th century the area developed with the mix of uses and buildings typical of early Toronto - institutional uses mixed with rowhouses, commercial chambers and small manufacturing. The 20th century saw the decline of residential uses in the area. After the building of City Hall at Queen and Bay, Bay Street became the financial and office centre for the region. The commercial growth of the neighbourhood continued with the Simpsons Department store moving westward on the block from Yonge Street thereby replacing Knox Church. Cloud Garden was secured for use as a park in 1989 through the approval process for the Bay-Adelaide office development.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Cloud_Gardens.html
608,43.590649,-79.513432,Colonel Samuel Smith Park,"Here in the park on the Lake Ontario shoreline at the foot of Kipling Avenue is a Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto plaque which can be found just west of the south parking area. Here's what it says: Colonel Samuel Smith Park recognizes one of Etobicoke's first settlers. In 1793, Smith, of the Queen's Rangers, was granted Crown land by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. Smith's tract eventually extended from Lake Ontario to Bloor Street, between Kipling Avenue and Etobicoke Creek, and included some of this waterfront park. The park surrounds the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital, established and operated by the province from 1888 to 1979. It was the first health care facility in Ontario to use a decentralized ""cottage"" system. Generous lands surrounding the building were devoted to agriculture and gardening. Patients helped to construct most of the buildings here. The farms and gardens, maintained by patients, were both therapeutic and productive - a model of self-sufficiency and modern treatment. Colonel Samuel Smith Park provides a scenic access point to lake Ontario and the Waterfront Trail. This significant public greenspace and heritage resource includes a 21.5 ha lakefill area created by The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority between 1983 and 1992. Habitat restoration projects include Carolinian tree and shrub plantings and the creation of a 3.6 ha wetland (a partnership project between Metropolitan Toronto, the province of Ontario and the Government of Canada). These projects help advance Metropolitan Toronto's goal for a healthy waterfront offering unique recreational opportunities.

610,43.693663,-79.294488,Dentonia Park Farm,"On the west side of Dentonia Park, east of Dawes Road just north of Danforth Avenue, you may be able to see this plaque on a post underneath a tree. Erected by the East York Historical Society in 2006, it tells how the farm became integrated into our city over the years. Here's the plaque text: In 1897, Walter Massey, President of Massey-Harris Company, purchased about 100 ha of land to establish an experimental farm. Walter named the farm ""Dentonia Park"" after his wife, Susan Marie Denton. The farm produced eggs and poultry as well as trout. Dentonia was also the home of a prized dairy herd that sparked the formation of the City Dairy Company. The City Dairy produced the first pasteurized milk in Canada, which helped to combat tuberculosis and typhoid fever among Toronto children. In 1901, Walter Massey passed away after contracting typhoid fever, but Susan continued to operate Dentonia Park Farm well after his death. Walter's brother, Chester (and his children Vincent and Raymond) and Susan's children (Ruth, Madeline, Dorothy and Denton) also lived at Dentonia. The Goulding Estate was built in 1921 for Dorothy Massey Goulding. In the benevolent tradition of the Massey family, Susan donated 25 ha of Dentonia, in memory of her husband, to the City of Toronto around 1926, for use as a public park to be named ""Dentonia Park"". Susan generously donated her home (built in 1914) along with 16 ha of Dentonia, to Crescent School (an independent school for boys) in 1933. Until Susan's death in 1938, she continued to live at Dentonia with her daughter Madeline. Crescent School operated at Dentonia until 1969 when it moved and the property was developed into the Crescent Town neighbourhood. Prior to 1900, the neighbourhood south of the Massey Farm developed, a portion of which became part of East York Township in 1924. Many other residential and recreational areas were created out of the Dentonia Park Farm, including the City of Toronto's Dentonia Park Golf Course and part of Taylor Creek Park. The Dentonia Athletic Field continues to serve the community with a soccer field, baseball diamond, basketball court, cricket pitch, splash pad and playground.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Dentonia_Park_Farm.html

Here's what it says: This part of the Don Valley was first permanently settled in 1825 by the Gray family, who farmed and operated some of the original 'Don Mills', including a gristmill, sawmill and distillery. In 1916, mining magnate David A. Dunlap and his wife Jessie Donalda Dunlap purchased the site for a model farm and country retreat they named ""Don Alda"". The Dunlaps incorporated the original Gray residences and portions of the gristmill into their farm, and in 1920 built this residence with its dramatic Doric columns. In 1952, E.P. Taylor acquired the farm as part of the planned development of Don Mills. It was eventually redesigned as a private recreational club for families and officially opened as the Donalda Club in 1960. The Dunlap residence was expanded by architect James A. Murray to serve as the clubhouse. The Donalda cattle barn, and Gray's mill, laneway, and houses are listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Donalda_Farm.html

Alexander Milne, a Scottish weaver, arrived here with his family in 1817. Milne's farm and mill operation prospered for over a century, eventually expanding to 240 hectares in size. For many years, the watercourse passing through this park was known as Milne Creek. In 1944, Rupert E. Edwards, proprietor of Canada Varnish Ltd., purchased the original 11-hectare Milne homestead. Over the next 12 years, Mr. Edwards introduced many landscape features into the garden including a large rockery, ponds, rustic bridges, flower beds, and a 9-hole golf course. Mr. Edwards' vision was to see the gardens become a public park. Accordingly, in 1955, Metropolitan Toronto purchased the property and, since then, has maintained the beauty and original character of this unique landscape.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Edwards_Gardens.html
614,43.641347,-79.431753,Elm Grove Garden,"This garden at the southwest corner of Queen Street West and Elm Grove Avenue has a plaque erected by the Parkdale Village BIA with the support of TD Green Streets. Here's what it says: The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (PVBIA) encompasses the area along Toronto's celebrated Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. Because of its close proximity to the waterfront, Parkdale was once a resort spot for Torontonians - with beautiful summer homes nestled among lush trees and plants. As Toronto blossomed into Canada's greatest city, Parkdale grew alongside it - transforming from a quaint beach-side community to the vibrant and bustling urban area we know and love today. This development has had immeasurable benefits for Parkdale; although sadly the transformation cost us many of our beautiful trees. The PVBIA, working in conjunction with local businesses, community members and proudly supported by TD Green Streets, aims to reverse this damage by planting trees and greenery within our neighbourhood, such as in this urban garden plot, located on the south west corner of Elm Grove Avenue and Queen Street West.Dr. William Charles Gwynne, one of Parkdale's early settlers, built his family home (which he called Elm Grove) on this land in 1833. Upon Gwynne's death in 1875, his land was subdivided and placed on the open market. Several new streets were laid out at this time, including Greig Street, which is now called Elm Grove. The addition of these new streets transformed Parkdale from a quiet rural settlement into a small incorporated village. In 1878 to 1883, Parkdale's population doubled in size, and it was designated a town.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Elm_Grove_Garden.html

Here's what it says: This building is a rare 1830s gristmill. Though it has long since been converted into a barn, it remains the most intact mill of its kind still standing on its original site in Toronto. The mill was built by William Gray who lived with his family in the two 19th-century residences across the laneway. The Grays ground their ""Wee MacGregor"" brand of flour here until just before the property was sold in 1916. The new owners, David A. Dunlap and Jessie Donalda Dunlap, built a model dairy farm here to showcase their progressive ideas about farm management and sanitary animal husbandry. The adjacent Tudor-style barn, designed by architects Wickson & Gregg, incorporated what remained of the original mill building and was equipped with every comfort for the cattle, including steam heat, fresh air ventilation, and soft radio music. This innovative cattle barn was featured in the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1928.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Gray_Mill.html

620,43.70259,-79.436646,Kay Gardner Beltline Park,"At the western end of the Kay Gardner Beltline Park is this plaque erected by Toronto Parks, Forest & Recreation. Identical displays exists at the eastern side of the bridge over Yonge Street as well as at the eastern end of the trail on Moore Avenue. Here's what it says: The Belt Line is the name given to a railway line that encircled Toronto and was completed in 1892. The Toronto Belt Line Railway Company proposed to generate and exploit a real estate boom in North Toronto by providing commuter rail and freight service from the new suburbs to the heart of the city. The line branched from the main line to Barrie and points north near Eglinton and Castlefield Avenues, headed east to Bathurst, then swung south east to Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road before turning south down the Moore Park Ravine and descending to the Don Valley and, eventually, Union Station. The railway was not successful. Toronto's real estate boom ended, and after only 28 months passenger service was suspended. The steeply graded section from the Don Valley to Mount Pleasant Road, being unsuitable for steam-powered freight traffic, was torn up during the Great War, and the rails were shipped to France. The remainder of the line remained in use until the early 1960's as a long industrial spur from Castlefield Avenue to Mount Pleasant Road, to serve local industrial uses along Merton Street. The roadbed east of Mount Pleasant has disappeared under Mount Pleasant Cemetery. In 1990, in recognition of its recreational potential, the City of Toronto purchased the Belt Line from CN Real Estate. Then City Councillor Kay Gardner was the driving force behind the City's acquisition of these Beltline lands and their conversion to a 4.5-kilometre long linear park. Since then the Parks and Recreation Division has enhanced it and nurtured the regeneration of its natural environment, while preserving a record of Toronto's late nineteenth century industrial and residential landscape. It is a place to smell flowers, watch birds, ride a bike - a place in the heart of the city to escape the city. Kay Gardner and her husband Raymond moved to North Toronto in 1961. Since then, she worked tirelessly, first as a citizen volunteer and then as a City Councillor, for her community, tenants, and particularly for senior citizens. In recognition of her vision and commitment to people and the community, the City of Toronto renamed the ""Beltline Park"" to the ""Kay Gardner Beltline Park"" in May, 2000.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Kay_Gardner_Beltline_Park1.html

The pier was designed by Craig  &  Madill with various structures in a flamboyant Moroccan style of architecture, and was to project 550 metres into Lake Ontario terminating with a steamboat landing. Financial difficulties in the early 1930s delayed the construction. Only the first phase of the redesigned amusement pier, 90 metres long, was opened on June 10, 1941 and it became popular as a major dance hall of the big band era during World War II and the postwar years.

During the spring, the stream that once ran through this site would have been teeming with wildlife and native fishermen would have lined the banks with gill nets and fish weirs to partake of this bounty. For them, the stream would have been a sacred site - a place of powerful and audible spirits.Philosopher's Walk continues to be a special meeting place to this day. The amphitheatre you see here rests at the point where a number of paths intersect and is a natural gathering place for university students, school groups and pedestrians from all walks of life.

It was later removed to make way for the construction of the subway and the widening of Queen's Park. The Queen Alexandra Gateway - with its elaborate stone pillars, serpent-headed lamps and elegant ironwork - was fully refurbished in 2009, thanks to the generous support of TD Bank Financial Group.

Queen's Park was long considered as a location for new parliament buildings and in 1879-80 their construction was authorized by the Ontario Legislature and city council, and an inconclusive design competition was held. In 1886 the commission was awarded to Richard Waite of Buffalo, one of the adjudicators. This decision generated considerable controversy among Ontario architects.

Landscaped according to a picturesque design, its sweeping drives curved past maple, oak, elm and white pine, while Taddle Creek ravine and McCaul's Pond formed the park's western boundary. Located to the northwest of the city, visitors gained access to the park through two gated, tree-lined avenues, one leading west from Yonge Street (today's College Street) and the other leading north from Queen Street (today's University Avenue). The legislative building, opened in 1893, brought a new public purpose to the park and significantly altered the original landscaping of its southern grounds.

Before the Second World War, there were more than 600 leased residences. However, shortly after its establishment in 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto Council (Metro) began to expropriate land to create a new public park for the growing city, compensating for waterfront parkland lost through the construction of the Gardiner Expressway.Metro begin bulldozing residences and businesses as Island leases expired. By 1960, one-third of all buildings had been demolished and the land cleared. In response, a coalition of residences and politicians advocated for, and won, an extension of the remaining leases, thereby delaying Metro's plans.Toronto city council increasingly favoured the Island community and its newly formed Residents Association and voted, 1973, to preserve the remaining homes, predominately on Ward's and Algonquin Islands. Following an intense legal battle between Toronto City Council and Metro, a 1981 provincial inquiry recommended that residents be allowed to stay for 25 years, The community's permanence was secured a decade later through provincial legislation, permitting the purchase of 99-year leases from a land trust.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Residents_or_Parks.html

The land had previously been cultivated by John and Melicent Scadding, recipients of the original land grant, and was then farmed by prisoners as part of a reform program.Riverdale Park was opened in 1880 on the west bank of the Don River by Mayor James Beaty and Henry Scadding, son of the Scaddings and an early Toronto historian. Following the annexation of Riverdale in 1884, the park was expanded to both sides of the river as the city sought recreation facilities for its growing population. The park was bisected by the Belt Line Railway in 1892, then by the Don Valley Parkway in 1958.The park has been a site for sport and leisure year-round for over a century.

Allan Royce, born 1835 in Rutlandshire, England, emigrated to Canada in 1856 to join his uncle, George Cooper. In the 1830s, George bought lots 32 and 33 from Honourables John McGill and George Crookshank. Wealth was made from the oak and elm trees, and clay deposits located on the 80 ha between Dufferin and Dundas Streets, Bloor Street to St. Clair Avenue.Before selling lands south of Davenport and building Preston Villa, George was considered to be the father of Davenport community as he provided the area's first church and Davenport Station. In 1884, Allan Royce took over the farm and became one controller in the Davenport Street Railway Company, which planned to connect Toronto with the Junction.By 1894, this company joined with the Suburban Street Railway to become Toronto Suburban Railway Company.

Here's what it has to say: From 1922 until 1955, few summer attractions in Toronto were more popular than the Sunnyside Amusement Area. Located to the east of the bathing pavilion, the park was created by extending the shoreline with fill dredged from the bottom of Lake Ontario. The Toronto Harbour Commission appointed the firm Chapman, Oxley & Bishop to design both the park and its buildings as part of a larger waterfront plan.Established as a summer destination, Sunnyside was modelled after English and American resorts. Most visitors arrived by streetcar, drawn to the midway rides, the games of chance, and the large outdoor swimming pool. Other attractions included the Miss Toronto beauty pageant, daredevil performers, and musical acts at the Seabreeze dance hall.Following the Second World War, attendance at Sunnyside Amusement Area declined. Plans for roadway development along the lakeshore contributed to its uncertain future.

Begun in 1922 by the Toronto Harbour Commissioners, Sunnyside, with its thrilling rides including the roller coaster, Ferris wheel and merry-go-round, became the best known amusement park in Canada. Its many features included the famed boardwalk, nearly 4 km long, which was the focus of Toronto's annual Easter Parade. Adjacent to the Bathing Pavilion (1921), the swimming pool was opened in 1925, and in the next year the first Miss Toronto Beauty Contest was held there. The Palais Royale (1921) became a popular dance hall, and in the Sunnyside Bandstand, concerts and singsongs were held.

There are many plaques here. This set of two has this to say: Early YearsPart of the Fort York National Historic Site, this park shelters the city's earliest known cemetery to be established by British authorities. In 1794, shortly after the founding of the fort and the Town of York, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe ordered this burying ground laid out in a clearing a short distance from the fort. Simcoe's own infant daughter Katherine was the first to be buried here. At least 400 others - many of them soldiers with their wives and children - were laid to rest in the cemetery before it was closed in 1863.By then much had changed. In 1837, a plan of subdivision extended the city's street grid westward into the area. The cemetery, oriented by compass to magnetic north (unlike the roads), was enclosed within a new 2.4 ha public square named after Princess Victoria. Victoria Square was mirrored by Clarence Square to the east, and linked to it by an exceptionally wide boulevard called ""Wellington Place."" Intended to create a prestigious neighbourhood, the subdivision plan called for churches to be built in Victoria Square. However, only the Anglican Church of St. John the Evangelist was ever constructed.From Burying Ground to Public Park As the neighbourhood around Victoria Square filled in, .8 of the square's original 2.4 ha were lost to private development or used for the extension of Wellington Street. The cemetery itself suffered vandalism and use as a cattle pasture until the 1880s, when the City moved to protect it by converting it into a public park. The surviving grave markers were removed to the park's western edge, the uneven grave sites levelled, and walks laid out. In 1899, a marble tablet explaining the significant of this place was erected by the Canadian Club of Toronto as part of the city's first series of historical markers. The remarkable monument in the centre of the park was completed in 1907.By the mid-20th century, the area surrounding the park was dominated by industry, and Victoria Square's history was largely forgotten. Beginning in the 1990s, the move of new businesses and residents into this area transformed it yet again. In 2007, a plan was approved to rehabilitate the park and celebrate its past.

As such, it provides high-quality habitat for many wild creatures and functions as a migration corridor for wildlife within an intensely urbanized region. The park has been recognized for its ecological significance and is now part of the City's natural heritage system. To protect and enhance the ecological integrity of Morningside Park, the City of Toronto has undertaken native tree and shrub plantings at this site. As it runs through Morningside Park, Highland Creek is surrounded by steep valley slopes up to 30 metres high. In some areas, these slopes are unstable and are susceptible to erosion due to the composition of the soil. Shortly after World War II, the valley surrounding Highland Creek was inhabited by people affected by a housing shortage. These residents were regularly under threat from flash floods and erosion near their dwellings. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto and caused severe city-wide flooding. This event led to floodplain land in the Toronto region being acquired by public agencies and the Highland Creek valley has not been inhabited since then.",Parks and Recreation,/Pages/Welcome_to_Morningside_Park.html

Here's what the French Toronto plaque has to say: Between the 1660s and 1759, the Humber River gained importance in the struggle between France and Britain for control of the fur trade with Aboriginal peoples.  That struggle led the French to establish a presence in what is today Toronto.In the 1670s, French trading posts opened at Kingston and Niagara to intercept Aboriginal traders paddling fur-laden canoes along the shores of Lake Ontario, en route to British outposts to the south. In 1720, a less significant post or magasin royal was built by the Sieur Douville near the former site of Teiaiagon, just up the river from here, to further attract Aboriginal fur traders coming down le passage de Toronto along the Humber. The post was staffed by a clerk and perhaps two soldiers, and lasted fewer than ten years due to British competition.In 1750, the French returned to the south end ofle passage de Toronto, and a new trading post, Fort Toronto, was built by the Sieur de Portneuf near here, closer to the mouth of the river. Within a year, that building was replaced by the more substantial Fort Rouillé (also known as Fort Toronto) on the site of today's Exhibition Place. It was burned and abandoned in 1759 after the British took control of Lake Ontario. The fort's remains were still visible to the first settlers in the Town of York (now Toronto) in 1793.

Originally, the home featured round-arched windows decreasing in size on each storey, sandstone ornamentation on the front gable, and stained glass windows. It also boasted a side verandah from which the Stock family could look over the surrounding fields and orchards. Edward Stock, an important local businessman, farmer, and politician, was also a local benefactor. Members of St. Leo's Church, Etobicoke's oldest Roman Catholic congregation, met at Eden Court before they were able to build a church on land donated by Stock.In 1889, Edward Stock sold the bulk of his land for a planned residential subdivision, retaining only two hectares around Eden Court. During the 1930s, the house and remaining land were sold to Willie Morrissey. He transformed the home into a lavish gaming house where both men and women could enjoy cocktails, roulette, and blackjack. Patrons even placed bets on ""Eden Court"", one of Morrissey's racehorses.In 1951, The Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 217, acquired the building and remained here until 2004.

654,43.641347,-79.431753,Elm Grove Garden,"This garden at the southwest corner of Queen Street West and Elm Grove Avenue has a plaque erected by the Parkdale Village BIA with the support of TD Green Streets. Here's what it says: The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (PVBIA) encompasses the area along Toronto's celebrated Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. Because of its close proximity to the waterfront, Parkdale was once a resort spot for Torontonians - with beautiful summer homes nestled among lush trees and plants. As Toronto blossomed into Canada's greatest city, Parkdale grew alongside it - transforming from a quaint beach-side community to the vibrant and bustling urban area we know and love today. This development has had immeasurable benefits for Parkdale; although sadly the transformation cost us many of our beautiful trees. The PVBIA, working in conjunction with local businesses, community members and proudly supported by TD Green Streets, aims to reverse this damage by planting trees and greenery within our neighbourhood, such as in this urban garden plot, located on the south west corner of Elm Grove Avenue and Queen Street West.Dr. William Charles Gwynne, one of Parkdale's early settlers, built his family home (which he called Elm Grove) on this land in 1833. Upon Gwynne's death in 1875, his land was subdivided and placed on the open market. Several new streets were laid out at this time, including Greig Street, which is now called Elm Grove. The addition of these new streets transformed Parkdale from a quiet rural settlement into a small incorporated village.

A farmer, craftsman and entrepreneur, Jacob acquired other lands in the vicinity and by 1819 owned a saw-mill on the Don River near present-day Cummer Avenue. Originally Lutherans, the Cummers became devout Methodists in Upper Canada: their home serving as a Methodist Episcopal Sunday School from 1816. In 1834, Jacob donated a nearby site upon which a Methodist meeting house was soon built.

He and his father were interpreters for the Indian Department and were licensed to trade in this region. In 1787 Jean-Baptiste married Margaret Clyne, a ward of Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, and by 1791 he had built a trading post here at the Toronto Carrying Place. When Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe arrived by schooner to establish the provincial capital of York in 1793, Rousseaux piloted him into harbour. He served Simcoe's government as an interpreter thereafter. Intent on expanding his business activities, Rousseaux moved to Ancaster in 1795, where he prospered as a merchant and landowner.

Here's what they tell us: Linking Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe and the upper Great Lakes, the Humber River has been vital to human habitation for thousands of years. Artifacts from a 16th-century First Nations community, as well as substantial findings from a 19th-century village known as Milton Mills, were found buried here near the banks of the river.Milton Mills developed from a five-storey gristmill of the same name at the heart of this small community that relied on the wheat and flour industry for its existence. The mill was built by William Gamble who had, in the 1830s, purchased nearby King's Mill (built 1793). Roads and bridges, also constructed for Gamble, connected Milton Mills with surrounding farms and villages.At its peak in the 1840s, Milton Mills was home to approximately 100 people. Many were Irish and English immigrants seeking work from the mill. Archaeological evidence shows that the mill supported local tradesmen, including coopers and blacksmiths. Archaeologists also found remnants of workers' cottages and of a tavern and inn for farmers travelling to sell their grain.Repeal of the British Corn Laws in 1846 fundamentally altered Upper Canada's wheat and flour industry. Later, the development of railway networks eroded local markets. Many small mills and their related businesses were forced to close, including Milton Mills in 1865.The remains of Milton Mills were part of 485 hectares of land purchased by Robert Home Smith in the early 20th century. Here, Smith developed a thriving residential neighbourhood known as The Kingsway.",Pioneers,/Pages/Lost_Village.html

Here's what it says: When United Empire Loyalists who had ""adhered to the Crown"" during the American Revolution and, in most cases, served in volunteer regiments, came to settle in this province in the 1780's, the region was largely uninhabited. These Loyalists, all of whom had suffered persecution and confiscation of property, were granted land in the vicinity of the Bay of Quinte and the Upper St. Lawrence, Niagara and Detroit Rivers. They laid the foundations of a new province. It was largely because of their presence that a form of self-government, based upon British law and institutions, was established in Upper Canada when the province was created in 1791.

661,43.641099,-79.434264,O'Hara Garden,"This garden at the northwest corner of Queen Street West and O'Hara Street has a plaque erected by the Parkdale Village BIA with the support of TD Green Streets. Here's what it says: The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (PVBIA) encompasses the area along Toronto's celebrated Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. Because of its close proximity to the waterfront, Parkdale was once a resort spot for Torontonians - with beautiful summer homes nestled among lush trees and plants. As Toronto blossomed into Canada's greatest city, Parkdale grew alongside it - transforming from a quaint beach-side community to the vibrant and bustling urban area we know and love today. This development has had immeasurable benefits for Parkdale; although sadly the transformation cost us many of our beautiful trees. The PVBIA, working in conjunction with local businesses, community members and proudly supported by TD Green Streets, aims to reverse this damage by planting trees and greenery within our neighbourhood, such as in this urban garden plot. Like the street it resides on, this garden is named O'Hara after Lieutenant Colonel Walter O'Hara (1789-1874), one of Parkdale's earliest settlers.O'Hara, who once owned this land, was born in Dublin, Ireland. A career soldier, he served in the Napoleonic Peninsular War, and arrived in Canada in 1826. He was Assistant Adjutant General of the Upper Canada Militia with the rank of Colonel from 1827-1846. Walter and his wife Marion accumulated over one hundred and twenty hectares of land in Parkdale between the years of 1831 and 1840. Their home, an imposing Georgian-style building named ""West Lodge"", stood at the head of the street of that name until it was demolished in the 1960s to build the May Robinson Apartments.",Pioneers,/Pages/OHara_Garden.html

Here's what the Rousseaux Family plaque has to say: As the nearby Provincial plaque indicates, a French trader named Jean-Baptiste Rousseaux (known as St. John to the British) provided a valuable link among the great powers that shaped what is now Toronto: the First Nations, the French, and the British.  In 1770, 11 years after the last French trading post in this area was abandoned, Rousseaux's father began to trade with the Mississaugas at the mouth of the Humber. Perhaps reusing the site of the French fort built by Portneuf, Jean-Baptiste Rousseaux carried on trade here until 1795 - long enough to help the British establish the roots of the modern City of Toronto. Other francophones then arrived to shape the new settlement, including the prominent merchant Laurent Quetton St George. The exact location of the Rousseaux home and store has not been discovered. In Rousseaux's day and well into the 20th century, the east bank here sloped gently to the river's edge, allowing for travellers to disembark from their boats, engage in trade, and begin the ancient Portage de Toronto or Carrying Place portage along the ridge now occupied by Riverside Drive. Since the 1930s, landfill has dramatically altered this area, filling in marshland and significantly changing the profile of the river bank.",Pioneers,/Pages/Rousseaux_Family_and_Early_Toronto.html

With his son Aaron, he constructed a two-room cabin and a saw- and gristmill. In clearing the immense pine trees of the old forest, the sawmill was able to produce - daily - over 3,000 linear metres of lumber. Mill Road was built for easier shipments of lumber and wheat to and from the mill.A small community began to grow around the mill at the intersection of Mill Road and Dundas Street. First known as the District of Silverthorn, it was later the Village of Summerville. The mill operated successfully until the 1850s. The Silverthorn family continued farming, and began reforesting 40 hectares of the area in 1878. Mill Farm was sold in 1958 for the development of Markland Wood, at which time many of the trees in the area were preserved.",Pioneers,/Pages/Silverthorn_Family_and_Mill_Farm.html

He bought 200 ha on both sides of the Etobicoke River and ran a mill. His son Aaron, bought the property between St. Clair and Eglinton between the Rowntree Estate and Grand Trunk Railway. William Perkins Bull described Aaron's son, Francis, as a ""quaint amateur physician whose hobby was hygiene, who called the teapot a 'she-devil' and who would not eat cake or bread containing salt.""Francis was the Silverthorn for whom the district was named after.

When he spoke at Maple Leaf Gardens on March 3, 1932, the great statesman had entered the Wilderness Years, a time when it seemed his political career was finished, before being revived so magnificently during the Second World War. And so he hit the road, just as he had as a famous young globetrotting soldier and war correspondent back in 1900, embarking on a public speaking tour of North America because he needed the money. Still, Churchill cut quite a figure, greeting reporters in the sitting room of his suite at the Royal York Hotel before the speech. ""Mr. Churchill's face is round and pink. His hands are square and pink. His hair, what remains of it, is gold - an astonishingly bright gold. His cigar is long and black,"" wrote the reporter from the Globe and Mail. Newspaper advertisements that day trumpeted: ""An unprecedented event - and unequaled opportunity to hear one of Britain's great men!"" Good seats were available for between fifty cents and a dollar. But even with the added attraction of the 48th Highlanders band, the turnout had to be a bit disappointing - just 6,000, less than half of the arena's capacity, and they had to strain to make out Churchill's words through a crackling public address system. ""His 'Can you hear me?' made one feel that he was putting through a long distance telephone call. The response made one think he had got a wrong number,"" wrote John Herries McCulloch in the Toronto Star. Despite those challenges, Churchill managed to get his message across loud and clear: a strong and united British Empire was the best protection against another Great War. ""Mark you, England's weakness is the world's danger, and the strength of the Empire guarantees world peace,"" he said. Churchill closed his speech with a flourish, playing to the many loyalists in the crowd. ""The Mother country has revived!,"" he said. ""She is gathering her children around her, and, hand in hand with Canada, will lead the Empire and the world out of the gloom of panic and depression back into the sunlight of prosperity.""-Stephen Brunt",Public Service,/Pages/Churchill.html

Here's what it says: Two of the greatest and most flamboyant political careers in Canada's history reached watershed moments at Maple Leaf Gardens, one drawing to a humiliating close, the other seeming to gain new life. On September 9, 1967, the Progressive Conservative Party held its leadership convention at the Gardens. John Diefenbaker had been the party's face since 1956, and for six years the Prime Minister of Canada. But after losing consecutive elections, the rank and file wanted him out. The Chief kept his intentions secret until the last minute, when he filed nomination papers, and joined a crowded field vying for the job. But on the first ballot, he finished fifth, and on the second, many of his supporters deserted him for other candidates. Understanding that his position was hopeless, Diefenbaker voted once more then left abruptly, heading back to his hotel with no intention of returning to the Gardens. In the end, he thought better of it, and came back at the end of the night to rally support behind his successor, Robert Stanfield. ""Don't, as the fire of controversy burns around your leader, add gasoline to that fire,"" he told the crowd. Twelve years later, the largest political rally in Canadian history packed 18,000 people into the arena, an echo of the Trudeaumania phenomenon eleven years before. But on May 9, 1979, Pierre Trudeau - the man Stanfield could never beat - was fighting for his political life, blamed by Canadians for a failing economy. Following performances by Sylvia Tyson, the Good Brothers, and the Downchild Blues Band, Trudeau took the stage like a rock star, and made a passionate argument for the patriation of Canada's constitution. ""What began as an embarrassment is a shame,"" he said. This time the voters weren't buying, though. Thirteen days later, they elected Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives with a minority government. Trudeau resigned, only to stay on when Clark's government fell unexpectedly after only nine months. The Liberals won a majority in 1980. And in 1982, the Constitution came home.-Stephen Brunt",Public Service,/Pages/Diefenbaker_and_Trudeau.html

During the 1840's and 1850s, Brown used his newspaper The Globe (which became the Globe & Mail) to publish articles and editorials attacking the institution of slavery in the southern United States. As a result of the United States government passing the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, thousands of African Americans fled to Canada. This law allowed slave owners to arrest both runaway Blacks and even free African Americans anywhere in the country with little legal recourse for the accused. In response, Brown became a major force in founding the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada. The Society fought to end slavery in North America while individual members helped freedom-seekers reach Canada via the Underground Railway. As a consequence, the African Canadian community enthusiastically supported his electoral ambitions. Brown was encouraged in his abolitionist politics by his father, Peter Brown.

In April 1845 work began on both the Cathedral and Rectory, which were designed in a Gothic vein by the distinguished architect, William Thomas (1799-1860). Consisting originally of a single two-storey structure facing Church Street, the Rectory was blessed by Michael Power, the first bishop of Toronto, on December 7, 1846.

New rooms and a cloister were added at the south end of the Rectory to link it with St. John's Chapel, which Archbishop Walsh dedicated on June 7, 1891.

William Lyon Mackenzie was elected Toronto's first mayor when the Town of York was incorporated into a city and renamed Toronto in 1834.3) The next influential family to move here was the Cawthra family in 1828 who would later make their fortune in apothecary (pharmaceuticals). The Cawthras became the undisputed leaders of high society, marrying into other well-heeled families of 19th century Toronto. When William Cawthra died in 1880 and left no children to inherit the vast fortune, it was divided up among the many nieces and nephews.

Donated to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1972, it was the family estate until 1997. As they changed from pioneers to farmers to professionals over 200 years on this property, the Ashbridges personified Ontario's development from agricultural frontier to urban industrial society.",Residential Buildings,/Pages/Ashbridge_Estate.html

Here's what it says: Casa Loma was thought to be pretentious, confused and not a ""real"" castle. It did not ""fit in"" with Toronto, and, in addition to the Norman and Scottish style of its towers, there were English, Irish, Italian and Rhenish architectural influences. One criticism cites Casa Loma's architecture as a protest against the ugliness of the Industrial Age. Another states that it reflects the 18th century movement of Gothic Imagination, which grew from academics and architects who rejected the style of ""perfection"" found in Greek and Roman architecture. Gothic literature, such as Walpole's The ""Castle of Otronto"", strongly affected gothic architecture, it evoked sentiments of the time: a pervading sense of fear, melodrama, high romance, the exotic, supernatural horror and irrationality.

Pellatt made his fortune harnessing the power of Niagara Falls to electrify the streets and homes of Toronto. A flamboyant entrepreneur, he was fascinated by the Middle Ages. Pellatt was knighted in 1905 as patron and commander of the Queen's Own Rifles, a Canadian militia regiment. His towered mansion designed by architect E.J. Lennox in 1909 is an extravagant medieval fantasy. At 98 rooms, it is Canada's largest house. The Pellatts moved into Casa Loma in 1913 and lived there for eleven years. In 1924, faced with severe financial setbacks, Pellatt was forced to sell his cherished home.

The following year, anticipating construction of Casa Loma, he hired E.J. Lennox to design and build these stables, estimated to have cost $250,000. The stalls were made of Spanish mahogany and the floors were covered in tiles set in a zig-zag pattern so that the horses would not slip. When the main castle was completed, it was connected to the stables by a tunnel.

Significant interior elements include a panelled storage wall in the south bedroom of the second floor and an original fireplace.The builder of the house, John Bales, immigrated from England in 1819. In 1824, John and his wife, Elizabeth, purchased 60 acres (24 hectares) of land on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street and Sheppard Avenue. They developed their property to include this house, a barn, and eventually, a large orchard. Around 1940, the family added a cool room for food storage (since demolished) and a kitchen wing.The house was sold by the Bales family in 1887. By 1922, the property was owned by the York Downs Golf and Country Club and the John Bales house became the home of the club's greens keeper. In 1975, the land surrounding the house became Earl Bales Park, named after a great-grandson of John and Elizabeth.

In 1839 his son James A. acquired the land and in 1840 ""Springfield Jimmy"", as he was known locally, built this lovely bank-house with stones gathered from the fields and bricks made from local clay. One of the founders of the first public library in Scarborough, he was elected its first librarian in 1834 and later became its president. His eldest son James George inherited the farm in 1881 and his descendants continued to live here until 1965.

",Spruce Court Apartments 1913,"In front of the apartments on Spruce Street, between Sackville and Sumach Streets, across from Nasmith Avenue, can be found this 2013 Heritage Toronto plaque. Here's what it says: Spruce Court is one of the earliest examples of publicly supported rental housing in Canada. It was the first project constructed for the Toronto Housing Company, an organization that included social reformers, business leaders, and City of Toronto representatives. Originally inspired by the Garden City movement and motivated by an affordable housing crisis, the company commissioned the architecture firm of Eden Smith and Sons to design this complex, as well as Riverdale Courts (later Bain Apartments Co-operative). The original 32 cottage flats - arranged around the grass courtyard - and six townhouses were designed in the English Cottage style with street level entrances and arched brick porches. In 1925, the architectural firm of Mathers and Haldenby designed an additional 40 flats on Sumach Street with steep shingled roofs and half-timbered gables. Changes in ownership and growing concerns about the condition of the complex led residents to form the Spruce Court Co-operative in 1978, and they acquired the property the following year.",Residential Buildings,/Pages/Spruce_Court_Apartments.html
862,43.648771,-79.372488,St. Lawrence Lofts,"Located just inside the doorway at 81a Front Street East, on the south side between Church and Jarvis streets is this 2001 plaque. Here's what it says: Georgian Corporation's renovation of 77, 81 and 85 Front Street East is a proud moment in the company's history. The residences known as the St. Lawrence Lofts consist of three historically designated buildings on the wharf. Each is unique, but similar as they represent a distinct pre-confederation architectural period in Toronto's history.77 Front Street built in 1860 for Alexander Mortimer Smith was a wholesale grocery warehouse. Smith, a Scotsman, was active in the Board of Trade and served on Toronto City Council from 1855 until 1859. The Smith Building is original in its materials and composition using masonry, white brick and limestone. Stylistically in its tall arches and mezzanine level, the building is an adaptation of Northern Italian Renaissance architecture, known in Ontario as Vernacular Italianate.Thomas Helliwell Jr., a brewer in Upper Canada, and his son in law, Thomas Clarkson, a founder of Jim Clarkson & Gordon, owned 81 and 85 Front Street East. Built in 1857 and 1858, the warehouse included the general offices and commercial activities of a wholesale grocery, handling produce, wheat, hides and leather. The Helliwell and Clarkson Buildings with their monumental pilasters and intended symmetry reflect elementary Georgian classical design principles.Georgian Corporation's reclamation of these buildings ensures that they will continue to be a living landmark in Toronto's history.",Residential Buildings,/Pages/St_Lawrence_Lofts.html
863,43.679225,-79.410703,Stables of Sir Henry Mill Pellatt's Casa Loma,"At 330 Walmer Road are the former stables for Casa Loma. This plaque, inside the building, is attached to the wall opposite the stalls, to the right of the door beside the tack rooms. Here's what it says: The northern part of the Casa Loma Estate, comprising the Hunting Lodge, Potting Shed, Greenhouses and the Stables complex was begun in 1905 by builder Herbert Elgie, according to the design of the prominent Toronto architect E.J. Lennox. Sir Henry Pellatt, one of Edwardian Canada's wealthiest men, was a prominent industrialist, financier and military officer of the Queen's Own Rifles Regiment. He took up residence in the Hunting Lodge with his wife Mary in 1906, and watched as their permanent home, Casa Loma, was constructed across the street between 1911-1913. The Stables complex was the first building erected on the estate, and accommodated Pellatt's Thoroughbreds, Hackneys, Clydesdales and Percherons, as well as his much loved 'chargers' Prince and The Widow. An impressive structure, the Stables features red brick construction, cast stone trim and a Mannerist-inspired design that owes much to the stables of large European houses. Situated around a central courtyard, the two elaborate entrance blocks are the main features of the L-shaped complex. The northerly doorway opens into the Stables, while the westerly doorway opens into the Garage. Both entrances feature heavily blocked engaged columns that support heraldic beasts and the Pellatt crest. Other notable elements include a stone squirrel (representing industry) and the QOR Regimental insignia on the Stables tower. The Stables served not only as accommodation for horses and carriages but provided small apartments for the stable hands and groomsmen on the upper floors. Beneath the stables were rooms for propagating mushrooms, asparagus and rhubarb. The interior of the ground level of the Stables features a carriage room with wooden trusses, walls clad in the regimental colours of the Queen's Own Rifles, mahogany stalls and Spanish tile flooring. The stalls still bear the names of Pellet's much loved horses- Casa Loma Belle, Prince Highgate (Prince), Matchless (of Londesborough), Lord Kitchener, The Widow and Indian Chief. Some of these horses were carriage horses, and others saddle horses, but almost all had won numerous coveted prizes and championships throughout North America. The ribbons that they had won covered one wall of the Stables, and the trophies collected filled a room. Matchless and Lord Kitchener were registered Hackney Horses and the latter had never been beaten in the show ring. Indian Chief, grandson of the famous American racehorse Hanover, was a young chestnut Thoroughbred who was schooled in dressage by Pellatt's stable manager, Thomas Cushing. The Widow was the only Canadian bred horse in the stables and was a much-loved mount, accompanying Pellatt twice to Britain for military maneuvers. When Pellett moved out of Casa Loma for the last time in 1923, his horses moved with him to the fine accommodations of Mary Lake. Mary Lake was Pellatt's country estate where he raised prize-winning cattle, sheep, horses and fowl, and was situated in King Township, a half an hour north of Toronto. In 1936, The Kiwanis Club of West Toronto (later known as the Kiwanis Club of Casa Loma) entered into a lease agreement with the City of Toronto, who had acquired the estate from Pellatt for non-payment of property taxes. In 1937, the property was opened to the public as a heritage attraction. Who would have imagined that a short time later the Stables would serve as a top secret location for the assembly of a newly developed technology. ASDIC, named for its inventors, stands for Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee. It was an early form of sonar and could detect a U-boat at a distance of 8 km. This device enabled Allied naval vessels to search for and destroy enemy submarines. As the original production site for ASDIC had been bombed in London, a new assembly location was found in 1941 in the Casa Loma Stables. Little did the touring public realize that behind a small padlock and a sign which read ""Construction in progress-sorry for the inconvenience"" ASDIC was being secretly assembled. The ASDIC project continued at Casa Loma until the end of the war, with only a few members of the Kiwanis Club being privy to the secret. Although Sir Henry had passed away in 1939 he surely would have been proud to have known the essential role that his Stables had played in the victory of the Allied Forces in the Second World War.",Residential Buildings,/Pages/Stables_of_Sir_Henry_Mill_Pellatt.html

Here's what the plaque says: York Cottage was originally constructed circa 1850 as a one-and-a-half storey brick structure in the Ontario Cottage style. It replaced an earlier log cabin on this site. The Johnson family emigrated from Nova Scotia and settled on these lands in 1797. Abraham, son of Lawrence Johnson, married Catherine Hommen Fisher and had seven children, all born in Upper Canada between 1801 and 1814. Their son, Abraham Jr., was born in 1807. Abraham Jr. and his wife Harriet built a brick home on this site and called it ""Ash Cottage"". Here they raised nine children. In serving the community, Abraham Jr. was Justice of the Peace in 1857 and 1871. He was active in the temperance movement, assisting in the formation of the first Sons of Temperance Society on Yonge Street. Abraham Jr.'s eldest son, Abraham S. was born in 1840. He married Sarah, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth Sheppard, and remained in the family home until it was sold in 1911. In 1855, after the death of Abraham Sr., Abraham Jr. sold the south half of the property to Joshua Lackie. In 1911, the remainder was sold and then subdivided. After the second storey was added in the 1920's, the house served as a rural cottage for the Red Cross and then offices for the Children's Aid Society.

Here's what it says: How did Grenadier Pond come to be? The answer dates back to the last ice age. Around 20,000 years ago this location was covered by an ice sheet 1 km thick. Over the millennia it slowly melted, forming the huge Lake Iroquois - 95 m deeper than its successor, Lake Ontario. The steep slope at Davenport Road, 8 km north of here, marks its original shoreline (see letter A on the map).As the ice age ended, the waterways readjusted, causing the shoreline to recede by 5 to 10 km (see B). Later the continent's landmass rebounded and the shoreline expanded again, eventually forming Lake Ontario as we know it today (see C). Water flowing from the north carved through deposits of sand and gravel left by the retreating glacier, deepening old rivers and creating new watercourses such as Wendigo Creek and Spring Creek.About 2,000 years ago, a sandbar closed the mouth of Wendigo Creek, and the trapped water became Grenadier Pond. Over time, the pond occasionally broke through to reconnect with the lake as water levels fluctuated with the seasons. When Toronto expanded in the 1800s, railway beds and roadways built along the lakeshore created a permanent barrier, and the pond's outflow was redirected through a weir west to the Humber River.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Carved_by_Ice_and_Water.html

Five tributaries - Fairbank, Cedarvale, Nordheimer, Yorkville and Rosedale Valley Reaches - add another 12 kilometres.The brook was named after the residence of Sir John Graves and Lady Simcoe built in 1796 at Bloor and Parliament Streets. It was named after their son, Francis Gwillim. Their time here was brief - Simcoe, nicknamed the Resilient Governor, left his position as Upper Canada's first lieutenant-governor and returned to England in October of that year. In 1812, Francis at the age of 22, fought in the Peninsula War and died in Badajoz, Spain. In 1829, the residence was burned down by careless fishermen.Even though Cedarvale and Nordheimer reaches are buried, restoration projects have been carried out to return the brook back to its natural heritage and to counter the overpopulation of non-native plants.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Castle_Frank_Brook.html

Here's what the plaques say: You now stand at the intersection of two ancient ""shared paths"", each thousands of years older than the nearby modern highways. One route travelled along the shifting shoreline of Lake Ontario. The second, a roughly 50 kilometre-long footpath known today as the Carrying Place trail - an ancient forerunner of Yonge Street and Highway 400 - ran north along the banks of the Humber River to Lake Simcoe. Following natural contours, these trails were perhaps in use shortly after people first arrived in this area, about 11,000 years ago. Much later, ancestors of today's Huron-Wendat Nation, Six Nations of the Grand River, and Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation established communities along the Humber path.In the late 1500s and early 1600s, fur-trading with newly arrived Europeans gave the Humber path even greater strategic significance. After 1649-1650, the Huron-Wendat lost this area to the Five Nations Iroquois, who built a well-defended village near today's Bloor Street crossing. By 1700, the Mississaugas had replaced the Five Nations village with their own. French trading posts at the mouth of the Humber River followed, the first being built in 1720.  While people of Aboriginal, European and Métis descent continued to use the trail, a new era of European settlement began with the British founding of the Town of York (now Toronto) in 1793, not far from the mouth of the Humber.In the 1800s, the river became a hub of water-powered industry, and agricultural and residential development followed. The Humber watershed was dramatically altered, with deforestation changing its water levels, pollution destroying its fishery, and landfill changing its river banks - including here at the river's mouth. Fortunately, archaeological remains have survived to tell us of the river's vibrant, ancient history. Pollutants have been gradually reduced since the 1940s, causing natural ecosystems to regenerate in areas along its banks. In recognition of the Humber River's rich human history, it was declared a ""Canadian Heritage River"" in 1999.

The Don River flows from headwaters on the Oak Ridges Moraine. 'Wonscotonach', the Anishinaabe place name, likely translates to ""burning bright point"" and may refer to the practice of torchlight salmon spearing. The Mississauga had a seasonal settlement here, where they fished and hunted the marshlands for muskrat, duck and deer. This settlement fell into disuse as the Mississaugas moved westward to a newly established permanent village at the River Credit.

From its source on the Oak Ridges Moraine and Niagara Escarpment, the Humber flows through outstanding natural habitats in rural and urban landscapes, to Lake Ontario.The name Little Thundering Waters, ""Niwa'ah Onega'gaih'ih,"" is how the original peoples of the land referred to it because of its rapidly running water and by the oral tradition as being a place where the Thunderers have been marked. At least 12,000 years ago, the watershed was home to Indigenous Peoples. At the narrows of the river is where Toronto, ""log in the water,"" got its name. There were great white pine logs across the river for the people to cross over the river. At this crossing was the Erie/Neutral, Seneca and Mohawk village of Taiaiagon, ""village at the crossing."" The village was a major ""meeting place"" for Indigenous Nations to gather for trade and council.

Here's what the plaques say: Urban development, including the creation of grassy public parks, has left us few places to experience the Humber Valley in its natural state. You are now standing between two such places: a marsh and an oak savannah. When humans first walked into the Toronto region as early as 11,000 years ago, they likely found a spruce parkland and open tundra landscape. The local climate and vegetation had changed by approximately 7000 years ago to resemble today's conditions, although the shoreline of Lake Ontario was about 500 metres south of its current location. The marsh at the mouth of the river was first formed perhaps 5,000 years ago, when the water level of Lake Ontario approached its current elevation, and the Humber River slowed here to meet it. The marsh's wide range of plants, fish, waterfowl, and mammals made it a vital seasonal hunting, fishing, and gathering site for Aboriginal peoples. Further up this path, a black oak savannah is a rare remnant of an ecosystem that once flourished around the lower Humber River area on the dry, sandy soils of the bottom of former Lake Iroquois (which preceded Lake Ontario 12,000 years ago). Oak, white pine, and sassafras trees grew in small groups across a savannah of grasses and low shrubs. This vegetation was subject to frequent fires, helping to maintain the ecosystem. Though significantly reduced in size and altered by both the loss of some species and the introduction of others, the remnants of both the marsh and the oak savannah have survived pollution, landfill, residential development, a previous golf course, and the construction of the adjacent Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant. Efforts continue towards the protection and regeneration of these remnant native ecosystems.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Humber_River_Marshes.html

It was a convenient trail for hunters, traders, explorers, missionaries and native community members. The Anishinaabe people in south and central Ontario won many battles against the Iroquois in the Beaver Wars. The victories forced the Iroquois to return to their traditional lands in what is now upstate New York. After a successful French-led expedition against a Seneca village on the Humber in 1687 or 1688, the Mississaugas built a seasonal village on the west bank of the river and used it for summer hunting, fishing and farming. In the winter, the Mississaugas would move north along the Carrying-Place Trail to hunt for food and furs.By the mid 1800s, encroaching settlements disturbed this balanced, seasonal way of life and pressured the Mississaugas to relocate.Mississaugas of the New CreditTransCanada TrailOntarioToronto 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am

881,43.63713,-79.39206,Plan of Toronto Bay,"At the east end of the Toronto Music Garden, at the southwest corner of Spadina Avenue and Queens Quay West, can be found a set of two plaques that tell us about Toronto Bay. Here's what they say: Plan of Toronto BayToronto Bay at one time contained a rich diversity of fish and wildlife habitats. Historically these included the shallow nearshore zone along the north shore, the many lagoons and bays of Toronto Islands and the large Ashbridge's Marsh east of the mouth of the Don River. Salmon, pike and pickerel were among the many fish species to be found in its clear waters. Grey wolves, black bears, red and black foxes were abundant, as were golden eagles and various species of falcon and owls. These inhabited the ravines of the rivers and streams and the shores of the bay.The Toronto Islands at the time were long spits of sand and trees, connected by a long peninsula to the shoreline. The 1793 illustration indicates the many streams that fed the bay, such as Garrison Creek (so named owing to neighbouring Fort York), Russell Creek and Taddle Creek, whose bend was the site of the original Town of York.Europeans and First Nations peoples alike both relied on the fresh, clear waters for sustenance: in the bay fish would be speared in summer and winter; the streams and wells were used for drinking water and for brewing.Today, Toronto Bay consists of a highly urbanized north shoreline and the extensive parklands of the Toronto Islands.The original shoreline disappeared over a long period of landfill (approximately from the 1850's to the 1930's), effectively pushing the north shore southwards to where we stand today. This was in order to accommodate the arrival of the railways during the 1850's and the establishment of the Toronto Bay as a major commercial and transportation centre for Upper Canada.In addition, many of the surface streams that fed Toronto Bay have been buried and channelized as part of the city's sewer system.The north shore now is characterized by a series of landfill embayments bordered by vertical dockwalls and a deep water nearshore zone. The existing conditions along the north shore have not been conductive to fish and wildlife habitat. However, with regeneration and the ongoing efforts to clean the bay's waters there are considerable benefits, most notable is the return of one of the most productive and biologically diverse areas in the lake system.

Historic Toronto BayIf you were to look diagonally north and west of this location, beyond the Gardiner Expressway and to the former railway lands east of Bathurst St. and south of Front St. you would encounter the original shoreline of Lake Ontario, as depicted here.The image to the right is an interpretive rendering of what the shoreline conditions of Toronto were like prior to European settlement. Toronto Bay was bordered by tall stands of an oak forest stretching from where Fort York was to be established, eastward towards the mouth of the Don River. The dense forest is here interrupted by the mouth of Garrison Creek.Sailing along the Bay 200 years ago, one would have encountered not only salmon in Garrison Creek, but also loons in the bay. Rushes and reeds bordered the sandy shoreline.Governor John Graves Simcoe and his wife arrived on the shores of Toronto Bay on July 30th, 1793. Mrs. Simcoe observed the following,""We went in a boat two miles [eastward] to the bottom of the bay and walked through a grove of fine Oaks where the town [of York] is intended to be built. A low spit of land covered with wood forms the bay and breaks the horizon of the lake which greatly improves the view which indeed is very pleasing. The water in the bay is beautifully clear and transparent.""They settled near Fort York. The 'creek' Mrs. Simcoe refers to below is Garrison Creek, and the 'clearing' took place near the extreme left of this rendering.""The Queen's Rangers are encamped opposite to the ship. After dinner we went on shore to fix on a spot whereon to place the canvas houses and we chose a rising ground divided by a creek from the camp which is ordered to be cleared immediately. The soldiers have cut down a great deal of wood to enable them to pitch their tents.""The illustration at the far left indicates the original military encampment (Fort York) ten years after Lady Simcoe's journal entry. The great oak trees were cut down, leaving large stumps. The mouth of Garrison Creek was deepened and a wharf added.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Plan_of_Toronto_Bay.html
882,43.653782,-79.350592,The Straightening of the Don River,"Where the Lower Don River Trail intersects the path up the hill to Corktown Commons can be found this 2010 Heritage Toronto plaque. Here's what it tells us: The lower Don River used to meander through woods and marshes before discharging into both Toronto harbour and Ashbridge's Bay Marsh, one of the Great Lakes' largest coastal wetlands. As the city expanded closer to the river, the Don's natural cycle of flooding became a problem. The slow-moving river and its marshy banks also became heavily polluted and, by the 1870s, were considered a threat to public health. In response, the City's 1886 Don Improvement Plan channelized the lower Don River to both speed up and contain its flow, creating new industrial and transportation corridors along its banks. By 1892, the river had been straightened, widened, and deepened from near Gerrard Street to the lake. As a result of this plan, more river valley land became available for development. The plan, however, did not fulfill its promise of bringing shipping to the Don. It also failed to improve sanitary conditions and prevent flooding, largely because it did not consider the full complexity of the Don River's natural hydrology. Beginning in 2006, the extensive mound of earth behind you was created to prevent the possible flooding of downtown Toronto through the West Don Lands.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Straightening_of_the_Don_River.html

884,43.65965,-79.39284,Taddle Creek,"This plaque can be found on the ground between the trees in front of the University of Toronto's Terrence Donnelly Centre at 160 College Street. Here's what it says: Near this location, a major stream once wove its way through the St. George Campus of the University of Toronto. Known as ""Taddle Creek"", the watercourse followed from headwaters in present-day Wychwood Park, off Bathurst Street, and followed a course that meandered south and southeast to enter Lake Ontario near Parliament Street. Taddle Creek was used by aboriginal peoples and European settlers as a navigation route and for drinking water. ""University Creek"", the watercourse, was a source of delight for the university. With the growth of the city, the creek became a popular location for fishing, skating and other recreational pursuits. In 1859, part of Taddle Creek was dammed to create McCaul's Pond (now site of Hart House Green) and a botanical garden.Beginning in the mid 19th century the urbanization of Toronto led into sections of Taddle Creek being buried or channelled into the city's sewer system. The watercourse was completely buried in 1884. Today, Philosopher's Walk, winding through the north end of the campus from Bloor Street West to Hoskin Avenue, is the only visible remnant of the former Taddle Creek ravine. Taddle Creek Road, just west of this site, recalls the path of the stream through the south end of the campus on its journey toward the lake.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Taddle_Creek.html
885,43.66533,-79.394841,Taddle Creek 'lost river',"This University of Toronto plaque is on Philosopher's Walk near Hoskin Avenue. Thanks to contributor Wayne Adam for informing me about it. Here's what it says: This naturalistic ravine park setting know as Philosopher's Walk was once host to Taddle Creek, which over time has become 'lost' to Toronto's citizens. Taddle Creek flowed south for approximately 6 km from its source area on the edge of the old Glacial Lake Iroquois shoreline near St. Clair Avenue where it joined the Don River as it entered Toronto harbour near the Distillery District. Water quality was maintained by natural vegetation covering the watershed and aquatic organisms in the stream course. Taddle Creek provided habitat for fish and wildlife and a gathering place for Toronto's early inhabitants, notable the Ojibway.As a result of the damming of McCaul's Pond to the south, impeding the natural flow of Taddle Creek, and contamination that polluted the river and brought about the risk of typhus and other disease, the creek was buried south of College Street by the 1850's and north of Bloor Street by the 1870's. The old town of York had grown and the surrounding neighbourhoods had intensified, making an underground sanitation and sewage system a priority. The part of Taddle Creek remaining at the surface on University lands was diverted to this subterranean system and buried by 1884. The topography of this ravine remains as a tangible reminder of Taddle Creek, with the dips and valleys defining the original river banks and the walkway itself following much the same path as the 'lost river'.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Taddle_Creek_Lost_River.html
886,43.633091,-79.472271,Toronto Carrying Place,"This Story Circle, the second of 13 story circles on the ""Discovery Walks - The Shared Path"", can be found on the east side of the path just south of the Gardiner Expressway. Here's what the plaques say: For perhaps thousands of years before modern highways, overland trails connected the lower and upper Great Lakes. One of those trails began near here, at the mouth of the Humber River. The trail's Aboriginal names are forgotten, but early Europeans called it ""le Passage de Toronto"" and the ""Toronto Carrying Place.""The Toronto Carrying Place trail followed the east crest of the Humber Valley, avoiding its swampy lowlands and water crossings to connect with the Holland River as it entered Lake Simcoe. An alternate route to Lake Simcoe followed the Rouge River watershed, while still more footpaths from Lake Ontario's north shore followed other major river systems. Their routes varied according to the seasons and according to the interests of the traveller.In the 1600s, the route up the Humber became increasingly import due to the lucrative fur trade with newly arrived Europeans. The Huron-Wendat First Nation, traders with the French, lived at the trail's north end.  In the 1670s, their rivals, the Five Nations Iroquois, established villages near the Lake Ontario trailheads to control the flow of goods. This included the village of Teiaiagon here on the Humber River. By 1700, the Anishinaubeg-speaking people known as the ""Mississaugas"" had taken control of the area.Beginning in the 1670s, the government of New France, stationed in Quebec, established trading posts on the Great Lakes to convince First Nations to trade with them, and not with the British further to the south. Le Portage de Toronto became a key supply route for French posts on the upper Great Lakes and, in 1720, the French built their first trading post here as a branch of their larger post at Niagara. After the French lost this area to the British in the Treaty of Paris (1763), a French trader, Jean-Bonaventure Rousseaux and his son, Jean-Baptiste, came here to trade with Aboriginal peoples using the trail. In the late 1780s, the British acquired the land along the Carrying Place trail from the Mississaugas, and planned the Town of York (now Toronto) east of the Humber River's mouth.  Vital to so much of the history of this area, the Toronto Carrying Place was used less by Europeans after Yonge Street reached Lake Simcoe in 1796. While much of this ancient trail has been lost to modern development, it can still be traced along city streets and country paths that follow portions of its route.

The route connected Lakes Simcoe and Ontario and was an important trade route for the Indian nations and later the French. Étienne Brûlé travelled it in 1615 and the Iroquois reputedly used it on their way to attack Huronia in 1649. Although of lesser importance to British fur traders, it still contributed to the favourable position of the settlement which became Toronto.",Rivers and Waterways,/Pages/Toronto_Carrying_Place.html

Here's what it says: This building, named in honour of Susannah Annesley, mother of John Wesley, was built as a residence for women students and officially opened on October 1, 1903. It was designed by George M. Miller in an eclectic style sometimes referred to as ""Jacobethan"".The initiative to provide for ""the Daughters of Methodism"" a home of ""high moral tone"" in an ""atmosphere of refined social culture"" was taken by Margaret Burwash (wife of Victoria's chancellor of the day), with the able help of Lillian Massey, Margaret Cox and other prominent Methodist women in the community who were known as the Victoria Women's Residence and Educational Association (forerunner of the modern-day Victoria Women's Association). Their tireless efforts raised funds from individuals, the City of Toronto, and congregations far and wide to buy the site from the University of Toronto, furnish the residence, and later help with its upkeep. The building itself, which originally boasted a gymnasium, infirmary, and dining room in addition to residence facilities, was financed in large part by a gift from the estate of Hart M. Massey (father of Lillian) whose generosity to Victoria also made possible the later construction of Burwash Hall for men. In late August, 1988, the building was closed for a year of major renovation and restoration work during which the dining room and kitchen areas were converted to bedroom space thus enabling more students to experience residence life at Victoria. Alumni and friends contributed $400,000 through the heritage fund to give the venerable old building a new lease on life, and help defray the $4 million cost of the renovations.

Completed in 1913, these buildings were designed in the ""Collegiate Gothic"" style by Sproatt and Rolph, a prominent architectural firm of the period. Burwash Hall was a gift from the estate of Hart Massey who attended Victoria College in its very early years from 1842 to 1845 when the college was located in Cobourg, Ontario. as directed by Massey's executors, the complex was named after the Rev. Nathanael Burwash, STD, LL.D., chancellor and president of Victoria University from 1887 to 1913. In 1931, the same architects supervised the completion of five additional houses (Ryerson, Nelles, Caven, Gandier, and Bowles) for students of divinity at the university's Emmanuel College which had been founded just three years earlier in 1928. These additions were made possible largely through gifts from individuals and pastoral charges in the United Church of Canada.

The establishment made in 1686 at York, England, Mary Ward's homeland, led to the foundation at Rathfarnham, near Dublin, Ireland, in 1821. From there, at the invitation of Bishop Michael Power, five young women, known here as the Loretto Sisters, came to open a school in pioneer Toronto in September of 1847. On May 22, 1928, Archbishop Neil McNeil of Toronto blessed the cornerstone of this new Loretto Abbey which would serve as both a school and a Motherhouse for the Institute in North America. Built in the Tudor Gothic style, the north wing and chapel were added in 1953. This plaque was blessed and dedicated by His Eminence G. Emmett Cardinal Carter, Archbishop of Toronto, on Saturday, September 14 1985.",Schools,/Pages/Loretto_Abbey_Toronto_1928.html

The land was included in the 1805 Toronto Purchase treaty between the British Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The schoolhouse was built as the public school system was expanding across Ontario and access to free elementary education became increasingly universal. The red-brick building contained a one-room multi-grade classroom, as well as quarters for the teacher. Before the school was built, classes were held in log houses and, from 1847 to 1878, in a one-room brick schoolhouse on the north side of Drewry Avenue between Yonge and Bathurst Streets. The schoolhouse here was in use until 1928 when what is now Drewry Secondary School, originally a four-room building, opened on the north side of the street.

Four additions were made to the building between the years 1906 and 1931 so that, at the time of replacement, the old school consisted of twenty-one classrooms, two kindergartens, exercise rooms, library, staff rooms, offices and a health room. On October 31, 1968, the Toronto Board of Education nominated the replacement of Withrow Public School - Junior as a project under the Study of Educational Facilities programme to be included in the 1969 estimates. It was not, however, until January 4, 1971 that the replacement became an active project. Construction commenced on August 5, 1971 and the cornerstone was laid by trustee Graham F.

It was to be the only home run he ever hit in the minor leagues.As a 19-year-old rookie, playing for the Providence Grays in the International League, he connected with a pitch from Ellis Johnson of the Toronto Maple Leafs, sending the ball over the fence in right field and scoring three runs. Pitching for the Grays, Ruth allowed only one hit, earning the title ""southside phenom"" from the Toronto Daily Star. The final score was Providence Grays 9, Toronto Maple Leafs 0.

Here's what it says: The Maple Leafs were in first place, the football season was in full swing, and the local sports calendar was mighty crowded. So forgive Toronto for treating a moment of history as a mere curiosity. On November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies opened the inaugural season of the Basketball Association of America at Maple Leaf Gardens, playing the New York Knickerbockers on a newly constructed wooden floor and showing off a radical innovation - transparent backboards. Fifty-five years before, basketball had been invented by a Canadian, Dr. James Naismith, and was popular in schools and at the YMCA. Ads for the first Huskies' game touted it as the ""World's Most Popular Sport!"" and ""King Basketball - Canada's Own Sport."" But this new, professional version of the game was alien to the city, and only 7,090 fans, not all of them paying customers, turned out to watch the Huskies lose 68-66. ""On the play our Huskies appeared short on both conditioning and competition,"" the Toronto Star reported. The losing would continue. A month into the season, player-coach ""Big"" Ed Sadowski, a future all-star, was gone, and by the following spring, after finishing last, so was the franchise, having cost its owners $100,000 in losses. But history was indeed made that first night. Though there were professional basketball teams in the United States dating all the way back to 1895, and other leagues had come and gone, the National Basketball Association - which was created when the BAA merged with the rival National Basketball League in 1949 - considers the first Huskies game as the first in its history. And Frank Biasatti from Windsor, Ont., the only Canadian on the floor that night, is recorded as the NBA's first ""international"" player. Other basketball games were played at Maple Leaf Gardens through the years, including many appearances by the Harlem Globetrotters, a series of regular season Buffalo Braves NBA games, college exhibitions, the 1994 World Basketball Championship, and occasional appearances by the Toronto Raptors before the construction of the Air Canada Centre.-Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/Toronto_Huskies.html

Founded in 1891, the club dominated road racing around the turn of the century, winning the prestigious Dunlop Trophy team race nine times. Because repeat winners kept their prizes, between 1896 and 1902 the Royal Canadians took permanent possession of a six-foot silver trophy, two large shields, and a cup.In 1899, the Royal Canadians earned international recognition when the team finished first in a Dunlop Trophy race held in conjunction with the world cycling championships in Montreal. Many of the club's cyclists were also successful in provincial and national competitions organized by the Canadian Wheelmen's Association.As road racing declined in popularity, the club focused on other sports, such as hockey and soccer. In the early 1900s, they won local baseball championships at Sunlight Park near Queen Street East and Broadview Avenue, and also excelled in city 10-pin bowling leagues.The Royal Canadians built this clubhouse in 1906, installing a cornerstone in 1907. There were four bowling lanes, a library, a dining room, and an assembly hall. An ice rink was added at the rear in 1929 for hockey, skating, and curling.The club gradually committed solely to curling and became the Royal Canadian Curling Club in 1954.

Here's what it says: In March 1966, the heavyweight boxing champion of the world had been blacklisted. Muhammad Ali - whom many still insisted on calling Cassius Clay - was undefeated, at the peak of his powers, and scheduled to defend his title against Ernie Terrell in Chicago. When the Illinois commission denied its sanction because Ali refused to honour the draft for the Vietnam War, every other American commission immediately followed suit.Montreal showed some interest, and then passed. By default, it came down to Toronto, where the co-owner of Maple Leaf Gardens, Harold Ballard, rolled out the welcome mat. (Because a ""draft dodger"" was allowed to do business in the building he had constructed, Conn Smythe, a veteran of two World Wars, resigned from the board of directors and never crossed the threshold of his fabled arena again.) Terrell pulled out at the last minute, which left the promoters searching desperately for a replacement only 16 days before the fight. They didn't have to look far. George Chuvalo had begun his professional career at the Gardens a decade earlier, as house promoter Deacon Allen built his record and reputation, moving him into the top ten heavyweights in the world. But setbacks and disappointments, bad breaks and tough decisions, had taken their toll. When the call came to fight Ali, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.Chuvalo won only a couple of the 15 rounds, and absorbed tremendous punishment from Ali's lightning fists, but the son of immigrant parents, the pride of the Junction neighbourhood, the embodiment of a ""new"" Toronto, stood tall against a fighter who, in that moment, may well have been the greatest heavyweight of all time. He didn't flinch, he didn't take a backward step, and as was the case throughout his long and remarkable career, he never went down. Ali called him ""the toughest guy I ever fought."" It was a loss that felt like a win, and it made George Chuvalo a Canadian sports icon.-Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/Ali_vs_Chuvalo.html

He was effectively banned from competing because of his controversial support for the political and religious group Nation of Islam and his opposition to the Vietnam War. Ali said: ""I will not disgrace my religion, my people, or myself by becoming a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice, freedom and equality.""Ali was scheduled to fight World Boxing Association champion Ernie Terrell in the U.S., but Terrell withdrew. The event moved to Canada where, only three weeks before the March 29 fight, Canadian champion George Chuvalo became Ali's opponent.Ali trained at the boxing promoter Earl ""Sully"" Sullivan's Toronto Athletic Club, which was located above a garage here. Fans paid between $1 and $5 to watch Ali spar and he used the proceeds to support the neighbourhood children.

Almost 4,000 spectators watched the Ontario Rugby Football Union champion (Parkdale) battle the Intercollegiate champion (Varsity) for the Dominion Senior Championship in Canadian rugby football. Donated by Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada from 1904 to 1911, the Grey Cup was first awarded to the winner of a playoff involving senior amateur and collegiate champions from Ontario and Quebec, with rules governed by the Canadian competition in 1921. In this era the game had numerous regional variations. As the rules evolved toward those of modern Canadian football, teams began to professionalize, and by 1955 only professional clubs competed for the Grey Cup.

967,43.66205,-79.37973,All Star Game,"Inside the former Maple Leaf Gardens, now a Loblaws, at the ""Canteen"" on the main level imbedded in the top of a table is this plaque. Here's what it says: Ace Bailey faced the man who had nearly killed him - and for a moment no one knew what would happen. Two months earlier, during a game at the Boston Garden, the Bruins' Eddie Shore took a run at Bailey and flattened him. The Leafs' winger fractured his skull when his head hit the ice. For days he hovered between life and death. Boston police threatened to charge Shore with manslaughter, and Bailey's distraught father boarded a train for Boston with a gun in his pocket, intent on killing the man he believed had killed his son. Bailey survived, though he would never play hockey again. On February 14, 1934, a team of NHL All-Stars, with Shore in the line-up, played the Maple Leafs at the Gardens, with the proceeds going to benefit Bailey and his family. It was announced that no Maple Leaf would ever wear Bailey's number six again - the first number ever retired in the NHL. During the pre-game ceremonies, Bailey came face to face with his attacker for the first time. After a tense few seconds, he extended his hand, and the Gardens crowd erupted in cheers. There were hopes that the exhibition would become an annual tradition, to benefit injured players. But that wouldn't happen until October 13, 1947, when the first official NHL All-Star Game was played at Maple Leaf Gardens. It was a rough night. Chicago's Bill Mosienko suffered a broken ankle after absorbing a hard check from the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson, and the Montreal defence tandem of Butch Bouchard and Ken Reardon mixed it up repeatedly with Toronto's Bill Ezinicki. The game marked the first time Toronto fans watched through glass on top of the boards, which replaced the traditional wire mesh. Some complained that it dulled the sound of body checks.-Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/All_Star_Game.html

Here's what it says: The last goal he would ever score was one that would be immortalized in hockey history, in myth, and in song. But on April 21, 1951, at Maple Leaf Gardens, when hard-hitting defenceman Bill Barilko pinched in on the left wing and fired a shot high on the stick side just before being knocked to the ice that beat Gerry McNeil and won the Stanley Cup, most of what would make the moment special was still to be revealed to the spoiled fans of the Toronto Maple Leafs. ""It was as clean as a hound's tooth,"" Red Burnett wrote of Barilko's shot in the Toronto Star. ""McNeil never had a chance."" Certainly it's not every day that you win the Stanley Cup, in overtime, on home ice. Barilko's teammates lifted him on to their shoulders in celebration, and in the papers, there was a picture of his mom, ladling him a drink out of the Stanley Cup. But that year every one of the six games in the finals against the Montreal Canadiens was decided in an extra period, and as for the Leafs winning championships...well, that was old hat. This was the greatest dynasty in the long history of the franchise, winning the Cup in 1945, 1947 and 1949, before the 1951 victory. But this was also the end. The following August, while returning home from a fishing trip, Barilko and a friend flying in a small plane disappeared over northern Ontario. He was just 24 years old. Their fate remained a mystery until 1962, when the remote crash site was finally discovered. And just as Gord Downie of the Tragically Hip sang in Fifty Mission Cap, it was only then, after Barilko's body was found, that the Leafs again won the Stanley Cup.-Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/Bill_Barilko.html

Here's what it says: All was again right with the world.What had happened three nights earlier, when a team of National Hockey League all-stars lost to the best of the Soviet Union 7-3 at the Montreal Forum in the first game of the Summit Series, was for Canadians far more than a mere sports upset. So secure was the belief in national superiority in the national game, that being humiliated by the Russians - who seemed to have somehow re-imagined how hockey could be played - was more like having the sun rise on the other side of the sky.And so a mere exhibition hockey series was instantly transformed into a contest in which it felt like an entire way of life was on the line.Game two at Maple Leaf Gardens provided blessed relief, restoring temporarily the old hockey order. Led by a stellar goaltending performance from Tony Esposito, the Canadian pros triumphed 4-1, delivering the comforting (and false) assurance that the result of the first game had been an aberration, a fluke, an off-night when Canada's heroes were simply caught unawares.""A smasheroo of a hockey game,"" Milt Dunnell dubbed it in the Toronto Star, writing that the difference in atmosphere between games two and one was ""the difference between a wedding and a wake.""The Canadians forechecked and hit the Russians, disrupting their intricate passing, seemingly discovering the key to unlocking the unique Soviet style. The highlight of the game was Peter Mahovlich's brilliant solo shorthanded goal in the second period, which came immediately after the Soviets had narrowed the score to 2-1, and appeared to have seized the momentum.The series moved on to Winnipeg, Vancouver ... and Moscow, and it would never again prove nearly so easy to Canada as it looked on that happy night at the Gardens.- Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/Canada_vs_Russia.html

On May 29, 1993, the Toronto Maple Leafs were just one win away from a trip to the Stanley Cup finals, where they had not ventured since the triumph of 1967. Waiting for them were the Montreal Canadiens, their great historic rivals, in the midst of an unexpected playoff run that would eventually take them all the way to a championship. Twice already, the Maple Leafs had shown a flair for the dramatic, winning playoff series in the seventh game against the Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues, and their fans filled the streets in celebration. Now, with the Cup so close, the whole town seemed set to explode. Only one small problem for Doug Gilmour, Wendel Clark, Felix Potvin and company, the best Leafs team in a long, long time, and their inspirational head coach Pat Burns: sitting on the visitors' bench wearing the uniform of the Los Angeles Kings was Wayne Gretzky, arguably the greatest hockey player of all time. Leafs fans will tell you that they should have won the series in game six in Los Angeles - that they were robbed when Gretzky accidentally slashed Gilmour in the face in overtime, drew blood, somehow didn't receive even a minor penalty, and then scored the winner a few seconds later. In game seven, though, there was no real controversy. Gretzky was magnificent, scoring three times, but the Leafs refused to fold, fighting back again and again. In the final seconds, trailing 5-4, with the Gardens' crowd as loud as it had ever been during the building's long history, they pushed desperately for the tying goal, only to finally be denied. It was a heartbreaking finale to an unforgettable hockey spring in Toronto. So close. So agonizingly, tortuously, close.-Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/Leafs_Kings_1993.html

Best known as a ""cathedral of hockey"", it also hosted political rallies, war rallies, religious assemblies, and pageants. Maple Leaf Gardens provided the setting for every conceivable form of musical entertainment, from the opera to heavy metal concerts. It was the battleground for boxers, wrestlers and runners, and has hosted innumerable bicycle races, tennis matches, ice follies, basketball games, rodeos, track meets, ballets, bingos, and circuses.The thirteen-thousand seat arena was built at the tail end of the Great Depression, in just over five short months. The building style broke with traditional revivals and achieved a popular modernism - a machine aesthetic articulated in streamlined, geometric forms. Retail openings at street-level gave the building a human scale, and both connected it to and enlivened the surrounding neighbourhood.The interior of the building was utilitarian and functional, with exposed structural concrete and block walls. The dome roof was designed as a series of massive steel trusses sitting on four concrete trusses, which allowed each spectator a clear view of the action at the centre.

On March 15, 1956, he defeated Lou Thesz by count-out to win the World Heavyweight Championship, and fans and the local sports press celebrated the feat - as though it were absolutely 100% genuine. ""Isn't it wonderful! Isn't it great! Whipper Watson, world's heavyweight wrestling champion. Just imagine!"" Steve York wrote in the Globe and Mail, under a mammoth headline. Longtime Gardens promoter Frank Tunney, perhaps a little extravagantly, once estimated that Watson entertained five million people during his decades as a local headliner.

And in 1965, the Whipper - who kept wrestling until being struck by a car and losing his left leg in 1971 - dispatched a nefarious newcomer called The Sheik. But that dastardly villain - whose real name was Eddie Farhat, and who hailed not from Syria, as billed, but from Detroit - would return, and in 1969 began the greatest ""winning"" streak in Toronto sports history. Week after week, he took on all comers at the Gardens - often with slippery manager Abdullah ""the Weasel"" Farouk in his corner. Employing all sorts of chicanery to which the oblivious referees somehow remained blind, he always managed to come out on top. The fans turned out in droves, hoping to see the bad guy finally get his comeuppance, including a record crowd of more than 18,000 on February 21, 1971, to see him defeat Tiger Jeet Singh. The Sheik's undefeated run finally came to an end after 15 years and 127 matches on August 11, 1974, when he made the mistake of attacking the referee, and lost by disqualification to Andre the Giant. -Stephen Brunt",Sports,/Pages/Wrestling.html

Here's what this plaque says: This 24 by 5 m mural portrays the beautiful Tudor Revival style homes of Humber Valley Village and The Kingsway, set in park-like surroundings and inhabited by people with strong family values. In the early 1900s, Robert Home Smith (1877-1935), financier and real estate developer, began the transformation of the 1200 ha of land he has acquired along the Humber River into high-end subdivisions. The Old Mill Inn and the stone arch bridge nearby sprang from Home Smith's designs. His motto ""A BIT OF ENGLAND FAR FROM ENGLAND"" symbolized his objective of creating Toronto suburbs of serenity through English Tudor Revival architecture. The Old Mill Inn (1914) and the valley in which it sits, have long been a part of the Canadian story. During the First World War, the original wooden bridge was washed out in a storm. In 1916, during the lean war years, a beautiful new stone arch bridge was quickly constructed to replace it, thanks to Home Smith's efforts. Today, this area located to the east of the mural along the Humber River continues to be a very desirable destination for leisure and recreation.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Bit_of_England.html

Carved from the oak forest, the estate included stables and an orchard.Robert's eldest son, Frank Prince Turner, travelled the world as an engineer. After his father's death in 1872, Frank returned to ""Bracondale Hill"" and helped establish the village. He built the village's first post office (with the area's first library upstairs), lobbied for a street railroad on Davenport and sold hundreds of building lots around his home, and south almost to Bloor St.Conrad Turner, the youngest of Robert's seven children, lived in ""Bracondale Hill"" until his death in 1932.

Here's what it says: The intersection of Dundas and Keele streets is the heart of the ""West Toronto Junction"". Near this site stood the buildings that formed the commercial and administrative core of the Town and City, The Post Office and Customs House which stood on the south west corner of Dundas and Keele; and the multipurpose Town Hall which included both the Police Station and Fire Hall which stood where the current City of Toronto Fire Station 423 (built in 1959) is located.Still standing today is the original Bank of British North America (1907) immediately to the west of this location, the Thompson Block (1889) on the south-east corner, the Bank of Toronto (1911) on the north-east corner, and the Campbell Block (1888) on the north-west corner which housed local businesses at the ground level including the Molson's Bank and on the upper floors institutions such as the Junction School of Music and The Mechanics Institute (which evolved into the Junction Carnegie Library, now the Annette Branch of the Toronto Public Library).After the sale of alcohol in the Junction was banned in 1903, theatres became the town's main cultural venues. Two of the earliest still stand today but are no longer used as theatres, the Wonderland (1907) and the Crystal (1909). The Beaver Theatre 1913 seated 800 and introduced the Wurlitzer organ to Toronto audiences. The Mavity (1919) had an upper level with removable seats for dancing and a rooftop garden.The Junction challenged Toronto itself for industrial development by offering rail sidings, cheap water for steam-driven machinery and tax free status. Transportation links also helped the town to become a retail centre for the farming area west of Toronto. From the beginning, The Junction offered jobs, investment opportunities, fresh air and liberal politics within commuting distance of conservative Toronto.

993,43.65531,-79.35548,Corktown in the 19th Century,"This 2017 Heritage Toronto plaque can be seen in Underpass Park, west of Lower River Street and south of Trolley Crescent. Here's what it says: In 1793, when the Town of York (now the City of Toronto) was founded, this area was a land reserve known as ""The Park."" Before European settlement, the land had been occupied and used by Wendat, Haudenosaunee, and Anishinaabe First Nations. It was included in the 1805 Toronto Purchase treaty between the British Crown and the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Situated at the mouth of the Don River, the area was marshy and little development took place until the 1830s when immigrants built small cottages with vegetable gardens.The population grew between 1847 and 1854 when Irish immigrants settled here after fleeing famine in their homeland, and the area was sometimes referred to as ""Corktown,"" after County Cork. Industry steadily developed, facilitated by the expanding railway network and by the straightening of the Don River. Corktown workers found jobs in breweries, distilleries, and slaughterhouses, with the Consumers' Gas Company, and in factories, such as foundries. The neighbourhood remained an industrial, working-class area into the 20th century. Large parts of the Corktown area were demolished in the early 1960s to make way for overpass ramps from Adelaide and Richmond Streets to the new Don Valley Parkway.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Corktown.html
994,43.73743,-79.34322,Don Mills,"This Ontario Heritage Trust plaque here on the northeast corner of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East has this to say: Don Mills was planned as a model town that would humanize urban life in an age of industry and the automobile. Initiated and financed by businessman E.P. Taylor and designed by Macklin Hancock, a young urban planner, it was built between 1952 and 1965 on 835 ha of land between the west and east Don River valleys. Hancock's planning team envisioned a self-contained community distinguished by consistent design principles and modernist style. Industry, commerce and major roads were arranged to be accessible but insulated from residential areas. Greenspaces preserved natural watercourses and provided pedestrian routes between different neighbourhoods. An immediate critical and commercial success, Don Mills has been imitated in suburban developments across Canada.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Don_Mills.html
995,43.662119,-79.504165,Dundas Street Crossing and Lambton Mills,"This Story Circle, the twelfth of 13 story circles on the ""Discovery Walks - The Shared Path"", can be found on the east side of the Humber River, 130 m south of the Dundas Street Bridge in an overlook just off a dirt path. Here's what the plaques say: You are now standing on the abutment of a former Dundas Street bridge. Dundas Street crossed the Humber River here before it was rerouted in 1928 over the bridge immediately to the north.The government of Upper Canada (now Ontario) chose this natural point of crossing for Dundas Street, one of Ontario's earliest roads, and a vital link between the fledgling settlement of York (now Toronto) and settlements to the west. Dundas Street followed the easiest (not the straightest) route across the terrain, perhaps following an earlier Aboriginal trail.This point on the river was an excellent location for water-powered mills, the first of which was opened here by William Cooper in 1807. Much like a major manufacturing plant today, the mills became magnets for other tradesmen, including tanners, blacksmiths, and coopers, whose services were necessary for the functioning of the mill. These businesses formed the nucleus of an early hamlet called Cooper's Mills.In the 1840s, the Cooper mills were acquired by William P. Howland, and a larger, five-storey flour mill was constructed on the south side of the Dundas highway, just behind you. In 1851, Howland changed the name of the area to Lambton Mills to honour John George Lambton, a British reformer and former Governor General of Canada. By the mid-1850s, the village of Lambton Mills was a community of 500 - a milling centre, a travel stop on the Dundas highway, and a social centre for the local agricultural community.By the 1860s, logging and agriculture had altered drainage patterns in the Humber River watershed. The resulting fluctuations in water levels made water-powered mills increasingly unreliable. Howland's flour mill was fitted with a steam engine in the 1880s, but nevertheless closed after 1900.Lambton also lost its significance as a travel stop when modern expressways rendered the former Dundas highway into a local street. Today, only a few structures, including this bridge abutment and the 1847 Lambton House Hotel (at 4066 Old Dundas Street), remind us of the original Humber River community.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Dundas_Street_Crossing.html

Here's what it tells us: During the First World War, roughly 2,500 people from the mostly working-class British neighbourhood of Earlscourt enlisted in military service, more per capita than from any other district in Canada. Over 320 were killed, and many more were wounded. Despite widespread unemployment and food shortages on the home front, residents of Earlscourt supported the war effort by contributing to organizations such as the Earlscourt Trench Comforts League, the Independent Women Workers Association of Earlscourt, and the British Imperial Association. The Prince of Wales (future King Edward VIII) joined hundreds of residents in August 1919 to honour the war dead and to commemorate Earlscourt's sacrifices by planting a silver maple tree at a ceremony in Prospect Cemetery.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Earlscourt.html
997,43.734848,-79.344935,Early Don Mills,"This set of three historical plaques, erected by Heritage Toronto in 2009, are located in the central area of the Shops of Don Mills located at the southwest corner of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East. Here's what they say: Early Don MillsThough now known as a modern suburban development, Don Mills was once the site of a small farming community. Prior to that, aboriginal communities used the nearby branches of the Don River as transportation routes as well as sources of food and water. While archaeological remains of an aboriginal presence may still survive beneath this soil, more is known of the European settlement that began in the early 1800s. Settlers like James Sampson and Rudolph Pabst (remembered in street names) established farms in the area. They were joined by the Hogg and Gray families who operated a gristmill (still standing on the Donalda Golf Club) and two sawmills on the West Don River nearby. By the 1850s, the crossroads of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue had a school and an inn. Further north stood a general store that also included the Don Post Office (est. 1868) and the local library (est. 1896). In the 1950s, this rural community was transformed into one of Canada's most significant post-war suburban developments.

From Farmland to ""New Town""In the midst of a housing shortage after World War II, E.P. Taylor, one of Canada's most powerful businessmen, acquired over 800 ha of farmland here. From 1953 to 1965, Taylor's companies transformed the farmland into one of the world's most innovative ""New Towns"", complete with 28,000 residents, over 70 industries, one of Canada's earliest suburban shopping plazas, schools, and recreation facilities. Don Mills was the first North American land development of its kind to be entirely planned and funded by the private sector. Its master plan was designed by Macklin Hancock in consultation with some of the world's leading urban planners. Centred around a common commercial and civic area, neighbourhoods are isolated from heavy traffic by looping roads and culs-de-sac. Light industry was welcomed on the edges of the plan. In an effort to create a landmark Modernist community, careful attention was paid to everything from the architectural style and position of buildings to their exterior materials and colours. Existing trees were retained wherever possible and generous green space was provided.

The Don Mills LegacyDon Mills has become one of the most discussed planned communities in Canadian history. Challenged, on the one hand, by critics of sprawling suburban development, it has also received praise from around the world for its attempt to create a fully functioning town where residents can live, work, and play. The development's success inspired imitation. After Don Mills, large private developments became the norm, with developers assuming the costs for the construction of public infrastructure such as roads and services for water and sewage. The road system of traffic-calming culs-de-sac and looping streets, popularized here, became synonymous with the suburbs. The central commercial core in which you stand has changed over the years, with a major redevelopment beginning in 2007. Don Mills' striking master plan remains largely intact - a landmark in urban planning.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Early_Don_Mills.html

Here's what it says: By the mid-1800s, this area was called Carleton Village. As farmland was settled, village occupations grew from local shops: a blacksmith, a cooper, a cobbler, a tailor.West Toronto Junction amalgamated with Carleton Village in 1889. The people who lived there were excited about the railways because they could travel and sell their goods. It also employed people as conductors, loaders, station guards, repairmen and engineers.Starting in 1904, the stock yards became an important part of the community. Nearby slaughter houses were where livestock was prepared for sale and exported to other parts of Canada and abroad. It generated millions of dollars.In 1892, the street car line called the ""Davenport"" went from St. Clair Avenue and Keele Street down Ford Street, along Davenport Road and east to Bathurst Street. These streetcars were important to people living and working in the community because cars were too expensive, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to use horses in a growing urban setting.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Evolution_of_Carleton_Village.html
999,43.702535,-79.451798,Fairbank,"This 2017 Heritage Toronto plaque can be found at the northeast corner of Dufferin Street and Briar Hill Avenue. Here's what it says: European farmers began a community here in the early 19th century on land that was included in the 1805 Toronto Purchase treaty between the Mississaugas of the Credit River and the British Crown. When a post office was established in 1874, the area was named Fairbank after a farm belonging to settler Matthew Parsons.By 1881, about 37 families lived in the community, near the present-day intersection of Dufferin Street, Vaughan Road, and Eglinton Avenue. The Fairbank Wesleyan Methodist Church was constructed in 1889 with bricks made in a local kiln; the building still stands across the street. When he died in his nineties in 1924, Isaac Dollery, a carpenter and early settler, had witnessed his community evolve from a farming outpost to a suburb of Toronto.Land in Fairbank was subdivided in 1890, coinciding with the construction of the Belt Line Railway commuter line. The railway made travel to Toronto easy, yet the line failed financially and ceased operation in 1894, after only two years.Between the world wars, residential development grew and the streetcar arrived in Fairbank in 1924. Industries such as the Paton-Baldwin Knitting Works and Fairbank Lumber and Coal Co. also opened in the area. Fairbank was part of the City of York until amalgamation with the City of Toronto in 1998.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Fairbank.html

1001,43.649959,-79.370417,The First Ten Blocks of York,"This 2016 Heritage Toronto plaque, located on the northwest corner of Front Street East and George Street, has this to say: In 1793, John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, established a fort and chose the site for a small town at a natural harbour on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The location was strategic, near major Indigenous trails to the northern Great Lakes, and considered defensible from naval attack. Simcoe named the town ""York,"" after Frederick Augustus, Duke of York, second son of King George III, who had recently won a military victory against the French.That same summer, Simcoe ordered his regiment, the Queen's Rangers, to begin clearing the site of trees. Surveyor Alexander Aitken mapped out a ten-block townsite bounded by present-day George, Adelaide, Berkeley, and Front Streets.Areas immediately east and west of the town became government and military reserves. Parcels of land on the edge of the town were granted to government officials, military officers, and settlers.By 1804, York and its surrounding area had a population of 1,013. The town included 75 wooden houses and a market near the present-day intersection of King and Jarvis Streets. Two red-brick Parliament Buildings stood south of present-day Front Street, between Berkeley and Parliament Streets. The Town of York was incorporated as the City of Toronto in 1834.

By 1792 a sawmill was established on the west bank and within two decades a small hamlet, known as 'The Humber', had developed. About 1815 James Farr, a prominent local mill-owner, named it Weston after his English ancestral home. The community subsequently expanded along both sides of the river until 1850 when a disastrous flood destroyed the west bank settlement. Improvements to the Weston Road and the arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1856 stimulated substantial further growth on the east side.

Here's what it says: Opened in 1957, Guildwood Village was the dream of Rosa and Spencer Clark, founders of the Guild of All Arts in 1932 and later, of the Guild Inn. The Clarks planned the transformation of 202 ha of their rural land into an idyllic ""garden community"" for about 7,000 residents, complete with schools, community centres, churches, and shops. The Clarks directed Dr. E.G. Faludi, one of Canada's leading town planners, in the creation of a master plan. Designed to calm traffic, winding and secluded streets retained many mature trees, and were free of overhead wires. Rear-lot parks were modelled after English footpaths as walkways within the community. The Clarks saved the 1839 iron gates of Toronto's Stanley Barracks and placed them at the entrance to Guildwood Parkway. In August 1957, the grand opening of the first phase of Guildwood Village featured the Avenue of Homes, a street of twelve unique, furnished, architect-designed homes. It attracted 25,000 visitors on the first weekend alone, and was dubbed ""the largest display of its kind ever presented in Canada.""",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Guildwood_Village.html

Notable settlers included the families: Adams, Annis, Closson, Cornell, Helliwell, Knowles, Morrish, Post and Richardson. In 1804, William Cornell built the first grist mill on the creek in ""The Highlands"", and during the first half of the 19th century, a number of mills, inns, blacksmith shops and general stores flourished. Shortly after the Township's incorporation in 1850, a post office, know as Highland Creek was opened in Helliwell's Hotel. Presbyterian, Catholic and Methodist churches and a schoolhouse for school section #7 were erected in this area and the ""Village"" was established.

Here's what it says: As the name suggests, Earlscourt was first developed by British immigrant workers, largely in an unplanned way between 1900-1920. Until it was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1910, there were no building regulations. Many people built their own homes often starting with shacks that they later improved or replaced. After annexation, owner-builders moved north beyond Rogers Road, then the city limits, into York Township.At first Earlscourt had no municipal services: a city-run streetcar line (1913), and then water and sewer lines were constructed after the area was partly settled. Then, stores sprang up along the streetcar line.In the late 1950s, a wave of Italian immigrants moved into the area making improvements in homes and small businesses.

1007,43.665321,-79.468617,Early History and Evolution of the Junction,"At the southwest corner of Dundas Street West and Pacific Avenue, three blocks west of Keele Street, can be found this plaque erected by the Junction Business Improvement Area. Here's what it says: The area known as 'The Junction' lies along an ancient Indigenous Peoples' trade route that followed the shoreline of what was once Lake Iroquois from modern-day Detroit to Montreal. In 1817, Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe built the Dundas Highway as a military road, to connect York, now Toronto, to the western end of Lake Ontario at Dundas, now part of Hamilton. The earliest businesses in the area were taverns catering to merchants travelling along this route. The Keele family established the Carlton Racecourse in the area and the first running of the Queen's Plate - Canada's oldest thoroughbred horse race - took place here in 1860. Following the arrival of the railroads in the 1880's, the old racetrack and surrounding area was developed by D.W. Clendenan. The Junction became a major industrial centre with businesses such as Heintzman Pianos, the Union Stockyards, Wilkinson Ploughs, Canada Cycle & Motor Company and the Campbell Mining Company. The town also had a Customs House so that local businesses could clear their railroad imports without having to go to Toronto. The Village of West Toronto Junction was founded in 1884 at the intersection of Dundas and Keele Streets. In 1889, it merged with the nearby villages of Carlton and Davenport, to become the Town of West Toronto Junction. It subsequently grew into the Town of Toronto Junction in 1892, then the City of West Toronto before it was amalgamated with the City of Toronto in 1909. Because of a wild reputation, and helped by the efforts of the temperance movement, the town voted, in 1903, to ban the sale of alcohol. The ban lasted until 1996 for most of the area and was completely removed in 2000. The Junction is home to the oldest purpose-built synagogue in Ontario and the city's first mosque (visited by Malcolm X in 1968) was located here. In the 1990's, the end of prohibition and the completion of a major streetscape improvement project revitalized the area and led to the economic and cultural rebirth of The Junction.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Early_History_and_Evolution_of_the_Junction.html

Here's what it says: For generations, people of diverse origins have lived and worked along the narrow streets of this colourful and distinctive neighbourhood. In the mid-19th century these streets were laid out over the Denison family estate. The tightly knit blocks of businesses, homes, and community institutions evolved as successive waves of immigrants, attracted by the relative affordability of the area, added their cultural imprint to the city. The district was first occupied by British workers, then by Jewish immigrants who converted the Victorian houses into small family-run stores by adding makeshift ground-floor shops. As a result, the area was known for decades as the Jewish market. After the Second World War, new Canadians from Italy, Portugal, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and Asia were drawn here, each in turn adding to the vibrant life of this culturally diverse marketplace. Tolerance and integration have been vital to the development of this cosmopolitan community, which is distinguished by constant renewal.

1009,43.761932,-79.411304,Lansing,"This plaque, erected by the TTC and the City of Toronto at the northwest corner of Sheppard and Yonge Streets, has this to say: A prominent landmark building, the Joseph Shepard House/Dempsey Brothers Store once occupied this corner of Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue. Built in 1860, by Joseph Shepard II, the building was constructed as a general store and originally included the Shepard family's residence. In 1886, a post office was added. The post office, and subsequently the immediate surrounding community, was called ""Lansing"". The store served as a depot for the coach from Yorkville to Richmond Hill. It then became the milk depot for local farmers and was the main source for all manufactured goods in the vicinity. In 1888, Benjamin F. Brown took over the operation of the store. He purchased it in 1904 and sold it to George and William Dempsey in 1923. From that time, the building operated as the well-known Dempsey Brothers Hardware Store and was owned by a member of the Dempsey family until the late 1980s. The building and property were sold to developers in 1989. In 1996, the building was relocated to its present park site just north of here at 250 Beecroft Avenue.

1010,43.763884,-79.411787,Lansing,"This plaque was erected in 1996 by the Corporation of the City of North York to celebrate 200 Years Yonge. It's on the west side of Yonge Street 3 blocks north of Sheppard Avenue. Here's the plaque text: The community of Lansing developed around the crossroads of Yonge Street and present-day Sheppard Avenue. Joseph Shepard was one of the earliest settlers to Lansing, building a log cabin in 1798 on the north west corner of these crossroads. An enterprising family, The Shepards built saw mills, taverns and in 1860 the well-known general store at Yonge and Sheppard which came to be the hub of the Lansing community. In 1866, a post office opened in the store and was called Lansing, thereby giving the community its name. Beginning in 1921, the Dempsey Brothers ran a thriving hardware business for more than 75 years. In 1996, the Shepard/Dempsey store was moved from its original location to a nearby park setting. Joseph Shepard also built a clapboard house in 1835 on today's Burndale Avenue which became a regular meeting place for the reform radicals of William Lyon Mackenzie, leader of the failed Rebellion of 1837. During the uprising, Joseph's wife, Catherine tried to shelter Colonel Van Egmond, one of Mackenzie's soldiers from government troops. As a reprisal to her, Loyalists set fire to the house. She managed to put out the fire, but her rebel friend was apprehended and jailed. The Golden Lion Hotel built in 1825 by Thomas Shepard, son of Joseph, once stood directly across from the original site of the Shepard Store. It was a much-frequented place, serving for a time as a Sunday School and a place for Mackenzie's reform members to congregate. At the turn of the 20th century, it also housed North York's township offices. One of the two oak-carved ""golden"" lions is preserved today in the lobby of the Novotel Hotel in the City Centre.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Lansing2.html

Here's what it tells us: European farmers settled in this area first in the 1790s. The Golden Lion Inn was built in 1824 at the southwest corner of today's Sheppard Avenue and Yonge Street, which became the centre of a small community. In 1860, a large brick general store was built on the northwest corner. Six years later, the ""Lansing"" post office opened in the store. During the late 19th century, other shops opened north and south on Yonge Street. Following the extension of the electric street railway in 1896, the surrounding farm fields gave way to residential streets. Lansing rapidly expanded in the 1950s with the widening of Yonge Street and the opening of nearby Highway 401. In 1974, the Sheppard station opened as part of the Yonge subway extension, and the neighbourhood developed into a high-rise, densely populated community.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Lansing3.html

Here's what it says: On this site stood ""Leaside"", an octagonal brick farmhouse built in 1851-54 by William Lea (1814-93), a York County councillor and magistrate, amateur poet and nature lover. In 1873, it housed the newly established post-office, Leaside Junction, and in 1884 the name Leaside was given to the C.P.R. station built nearby. In 1912, the York Land Company, which had considerable property in the area, surveyed a townsite, appropriately called Leaside. Incorporated in 1913, the Town of Leaside became part of the Borough of East York in 1967.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Leaside.html

Here's what it says: The development of the Town of Leaside, named for 19th-century farmer and settler William Lea, is historically linked to the Canadian Pacific and Canadian Northern Railways. By 1894, a railway station was established at ""Leaside Junction"". The Canadian Northern Railway subsequently acquired substantial holdings in the area for the development of a locomotive repair shop and a marshalling yard for its Eastern Lines. In 1912, the Canadian Northern Railway announced its intention to build a large residential community, commissioning noted Montreal-based landscape architect Frederick Todd to design a model town. The Town of Leaside was incorporated in May 1913, with a population of 43, and land was advertised for sale a month later. Monies from the sale of the land were intended to finance the railway line's maintenance facilities. In the late 1930s, industrial development along Laird Drive - which had become a hub for manufacturers - stimulated residential growth.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Leaside_A_Railway_Town.html

In front of the park is this 2014 Heritage Toronto plaque. Here's what it says: A small number of immigrants from Malta first arrived in Toronto in the late 19th century. By 1916, having fled overpopulation and unemployment, some 200 Maltese had established themselves in Toronto in two communities. One was the area of Dundas and McCaul Streets, and the other here in The Junction, near present-day Malta Park. Many worked in this district's meat packing industry that was generated by the nearby Union Stock Yards (since demolished). The Maltese-Canadian Society of Toronto, established in 1922, supported the two growing communities.Predominantly Roman Catholics, the Maltese living in The Junction first attended nearby St. Cecilia Church. In 1930, with aid from the Maltese-Canadian Society of Toronto, the community built St. Paul the Apostle Church on Dundas Street West. It was one of the first Maltese churches in North America. After the Second World War, more Maltese emigrated to Canada and settled in this neighbourhood. The resulting density of Maltese homes, businesses, and community organizations gave this area the name ""Little Malta"".",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Maltese_Community.html
1015,43.78523,-79.41723,Newtonbrook,"In this area was once located the community of Newtonbrook. Today, little trace of it remains. However, at 5800 Yonge Street on the west side, at the north end of that Toronto Hydro property, you will find this plaque which was erected in 1996 by the Corporation of the City of North York to celebrate 200 Years Yonge. Here's what it says about the former community: Centred at Yonge Street and Drewry Avenue, Newtonbrook forms North York's most northern Yonge Street community. By 1870 Newtonbrook was considered a thriving village with more than 200 settlers establishing homes at these crossroads. As early as 1801, Newtonbrook claimed one of the first log schools in North York. The early 1800s also saw two mill sites along Yonge Street, the Playter Mill at Drewry and the Cummer Mills at present-day Cummer Avenue. The Cummer Mill site was operated by John Cummer and owned by his father Jacob of Willowdale. For years, many religious camp meetings were held at the mill site, some of which reportedly went on for days. Descendants of York Mill's Humberstone family also made their home in Newtonbrook. Having apprenticed with his father, Thomas Humberstone opened a pottery in 1835 on the west side of Yonge Street, south of Steeles were earthenware pitches, vases and bricks were manufactured. Some of the most popular inns and taverns were found in Newtonbrook including Finch's Hotel built in 1847 on the north east corner of what is now Finch Avenue. In 1857 the Newton Brook Wesleyan Methodist Church Congregation was formed and named after a local preacher, the name by which the community became known. Although a church wasn't erected until 1857, it's not the house of worship itself which is most remembered, but its parsonage, as it was the birthplace of Lester B. Pearson, elected Canada's Prime Minister in 1963. Today, little remains of early Newtonbrook. A general store and post office at the north west corner of Drewey and Yonge was originally known as the C.C. Charleton's store. The frame structure was replaced in 1907 and continues to function as a commercial business.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Newtonbrook.html
1016,43.78742,-79.41764,Newtonbrook,"This 2012 Heritage Toronto plaque can be found on the west side of Yonge Street just north of Drewry Avenue. Here's what it says: The intersection of Yonge Street and Drewry Avenue was once the centre of a rural community known as ""Newtonbrook"". The community took its name from the Newton Brook Wesleyan Methodist Church, founded in 1857. A post office opened inside a general store on this corner in 1863. Along with a small cluster of local shops, a school, and the church, Newtonbrook became an important nucleus for local residents and families farming nearby. Mills on the Don River, and Humberstone's Pottery located north of here on Yonge Street, further contributed to the growth of the area.Over the course of the 20th century, Newtonbrook was absorbed into the urban expansion of North York and the City of Toronto. Today, the former general store on the northwest corner of Drewry Avenue and Yonge Street, rebuilt after a 1907 fire, is the most prominent survivor of the earlier community.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Newtonbrook2.html

On this site, at 320 Kingston Road, stood the Norway Post Office. The building and a companion cottage at 322 Kingston Road were built about 1825 of board and batten construction. The settlement began with the establishment of the Norway steam saw mill, built in 1835. A toll gate, hotels and blacksmiths' shops followed as the community, known as Norway, grew. In 1866 its population reached 100 and the Post Office was opened with John E. Winnett as Postmaster. In 1907 the Norway Post Office was renamed Toronto Sub Office No. 4. Two years later the settlement was annexed to Toronto. The building ceased to be used as a post office in 1955 and was demolished on October 10, 1982.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Norway_Post_Office.html
1018,43.674231,-79.45973,Prohibition,"Attached to this westbound St. Clair Avenue West transit shelter at Silverthorn Avenue is this City of Toronto plaque. Here's what it says: A temperance movement was led by Reverend T.E. Egerton Shore of the Annette Street Methodist Church. Public encounters of drunkenness, fights and one murder were enough for the town of West Toronto to vote ""dry"" in 1904. Eliminating the sale of alcohol was thought to raise the ""moral fibre"" of the community. Taverns, hotels and inns were denounced as ""cesspools of harlotry, vice and iniquity"". When DW Clendenan, a teetotaler and the town's mayor, ran for provincial office in 1890, his rival, David Gilmour, pointed out that he also owned the Swan Hotel. The ban was upheld despite referendums held in 1966, 1972, 1984 and 1988. After rail and factories left, neighbours in support and opposition of the ban both wanted to revitalize their community. Allowing the sale of alcohol would attract people to restaurants, bars and other places of social life. This especially became important in two former City of West Toronto wards with an upcoming municipal election in 1997 - to include the wet/dry vote on the ballot. Over 90 years passed when the ban was lifted.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Prohibition.html

Each was granted 160 ha and David built a log cabin on his property that year. He was soon joined by other settlers, including his brothers Andrew and Archibald. The Thomsons, who were stone masons, worked on the first Parliament Buildings at York (Toronto). A road connecting the settlement with York was opened by 1799, and a sawmill was built by each of the brothers.

A third share in the mill property was held, 1799-1805, by their brother-in-law, Parshall Terry, a member of the first Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, who had moved to this area by 1798. Terry lived nearby until his death in 1808. Later the mills were jointly owned by Colin Skinner and John Eastwood. By 1823 Thomas Helliwell had built a brewery and a distillery in the immediate vicinity and within four years Eastwood and Skinner had constructed the second paper mill in Upper Canada.

Here's what they have to say: The first Chinese resident recorded in Toronto was Sam Ching, the owner of a hand laundry business on Adelaide Street in 1878. Though immigration to Canada directly from China was restricted after 1885, Ching was eventually joined by Chinese men who migrated from western Canada after helping to build the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Between 1900 and 1925, Toronto's first Chinese community took shape here, around Elizabeth Street which one ran all the way south to Queen Street. 'Chinatown' was a bustling commercial and residential area that included restaurants, grocery stores, and traditional clan associations. This first Chinatown thrived until the late 1940s, when the City of Toronto began its controversial expropriation of much of the neighbourhood to make room for a new city hall and the future Nathan Phillips Square. Demolition finally took place in 1955. Some Chinese businesses could not afford to re-locate, and closed. Others packed up and moved west along Dundas Street to Spadina Avenue where they became the heart of today's 'Old Chinatown'.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Torontos_First_Chinatown.html

Less than a year later, on 7 April 1890, it changed status to become the Town of North Toronto, with a population of 1,000. The boundaries were expanded in 1892. The town developed around three crossroads on Yonge Street at Davisville, Montgomery and Bedford Park Avenues. Farmlands surrounded these three centres. The thriving town was annexed by the City of Toronto 15 December 1912. The town hall, originally built for York Township and purchased by the Town of North Toronto in 1891, was located on this site, until it was demolished in 1931.

Here's what they say: Village of YorkvilleOnce crossed by an ancient aboriginal trail (Davenport Road), the area known today as Yorkville was first permanently settled by those of European descent in the early 1800s. The Red Lion Inn, one of the first buildings in the area, was a stagecoach stop and vital gathering place. Economic growth was spurred by brick-making and brewing industries established from the 1830s.The community was linked in 1849 to the City of Toronto by H.B. Williams' horse-drawn omnibus service. In 1853 it was incorporation as the Village of Yorkville. Despite annexation by the City of Toronto in 1883, Yorkville remained a quiet community of predominantly middle- and working-class people well into the 20th century.In the 1950s, artists and actors transformed the area into a thriving arts community. By the mid- to late 1960s, Yorkville had become famous for its ""hippies,"" folk music, and coffee houses. Redevelopment has since altered much of the old incorporated Village. Still, streets north of Yorkville Avenue, west of Avenue Road (now part of the Annex), and east of Yonge Street (now part of South Rosedale) retain much of their 19th- and early 20th-century character.
	
	
Yorkville Town HallDesigned by William Hay, one of Toronto's most important early architects, the Yorkville Town Hall was built by William McGinnis, and opened on this site in 1860, fronting onto Yonge Street. High Victorian in style, it was constructed of local 'white' (yellow) bricks with red and blackened brick trim, and boasted three stained glass rose windows that illuminated a third-floor public hall seating 500.In its second-floor Council Chamber, local politicians debated, among other things, ""the running at large of Pigs and Swine and Poultry,"" the planking of sidewalks, and the ""prevention of immoderate driving."" In 1861, the privately owned horse-drawn Toronto Street Railway commenced service from the Town Hall to the St. Lawrence Market. After the clock tower was completed in 1889, the Town Hall's bells sounded the working day and rang for fire alarms.After annexation in 1883 ended Yorkville's village government, the Council Chamber was used as a public library. The building also housed the Yorkville Company of the York Rangers, the Naval Club, the offices of the Toronto Street Railway, and provided space for community use.The Yorkville Town Hall was destroyed by fire on November 12, 1941.

The name ""Willowdale"" appeared after the opening of the area's first post office, named ""Willow Dale,"" in 1855.Largely unchanged until early in the 20th century, Willowdale then began to expand with the development of new residential streets, at first stretching out on either side of Yonge Street. In 1923, it became the site of the new offices of the Township of North York.

[As of July 2015, the plaque is no longer at this location] Here's what it says: The original community of Willowdale was established between Lansing and Newtonbrook on today's Park Home and Finch Avenues. Jacob and Elizabeth Cummer (Kummer) and their family were some of the earliest to settle in the area along with the Johnston, Willson and McBride families. The early community was often referred to as Kummer's Settlement. The Cummers are credited with having donated land on which a Methodist log chapel was built in 1834 at the north east corner of to-day's Yonge and Church Avenue. Adjacent to the church, the Johnston family offered part of their land to serve as a family burial ground. In 1856 the log church was replaced with a brick structure which boasted a towering, artistic spire that could be seen for miles around until a severe storm tore it down. Part of the original church site still remains as this pioneer cemetery built in memory of the early settlers who helped to establish the Willowdale Methodist Church. Willowdale boasted one of the earliest schools located at present-day Yonge Street and Ellerslie Avenue. The Willowdale School, SS #4 also known as Brown's School was originally built in 1842 with bricks made on the neighbouring farm of David Gibson. David Gibson, a land surveyor, farmer and politician is best remembered for his actions in the ill-fated Rebellion of 1837. As a result of his participation in the rebellion, Gibson's first home, which he and his wife, Eliza, built in 1829, was torched by government troops. With a price on his head for high treason, Gibson fled to the U.S. He and his family returned to Willowdale and, in 1851 built a new home on the same site. The Gibson House still stands today as a historic museum on Yonge Street north of City Hall. In 1855 Gibson opened the Willowdale post office just north of his farm, naming it after the number of willow trees in the area, thereby giving the community its name.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/Willowdale2.html

Here's what it says: The Village of York Mills grew up around three mill sites on the west branch of the Don River about 10 km north of Toronto. From the opening of Samuel Heron's Mill in 1804 until 1926 when George Pratt's operation closed, the sounds and aromas of flour-mills, cider-mills and saw-mills filled the valley. In 1870 the Village of York Mills had a population of 100. James Hogg owned property in the vicinity from 1824. After the Hogg brothers began to develop it in the 1850'S the area was also known as Hogg's Hollow.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/York_Mills1.html

[I have been informed that, as of August 2008, the plaque no longer exists at this location. If anyone knows its present location, please contact me at the email link in the menu.] Here's what's on it: In 1796, Thomas Mercer, a Loyalist, acquired some 80 ha of land in this vicinity. James Hogg, an enterprising Scottish emigrant, purchased part of this property about 1818 and built a grist-mill on the west branch of the Don River near here. In the 1820's the mill became the nucleus of a small settlement known as Hogg's Hollow. The first St. John's Anglican Church (1817) was among the earliest built north of York. When the course of Yonge Street was changed in 1836, new mills, a tavern and a tannery were constructed to serve this rapidly growing community, and following the establishment of a post office, it became known as York Mills.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/York_Mills2.html
1036,43.744429,-79.407248,York Mills,"On the northwest corner, attached to the subway entrance wall, is this plaque which was erected in 1996 by the Corporation of the City of North York to celebrate 200 Years Yonge. Here's what it says: York Mills was established around mill sites on the west branch of the Don River. The community underwent several name changes which usually reflected the names of the most powerful mill owners. The first grist and saw mill was opened in 1804 by Samuel Heron on the east side of Yonge Street south of today's York Mills Road. In 1817, Millford Mills was opened farther north by Thomas Arnold. Seven years later, the Arnold mill property was bought by James Hogg, a prominent York Mills settler. Today, the area is still commonly referred to as Hogg's Hollow, the name of a subdivision plan developed by the Hogg family in 1856. An unsuccessful venture, the Hogg family sold only a few lots on what used to be John Street where only three worker's cottages were built. Today, two of these cottages have been incorporated into the Auberge du Pommier Restaurant. A little farther south, York Mills also claims the well-known Yonge Street landmark, the Jolly Miller Tavern. It too was built by the Hogg family in 1857 as the York Mills Hotel. During the Prohibition Years (1916-1927) the inn was a much frequented gambling spot to which the police made regular raids. It wasn't until the 1930s that the tavern was remodelled and renamed the Jolly Miller. For a short time, the Jolly Miller also housed one of Canada's most famous historical artists, C.W. Jefferys. His illustrations of early Canadian life are among the most treasured reminders of days gone by. At present, Old Yonge Street remains as the original Yonge Street path through the York Mills valley. Many historic structures still stand on Old Yonge Street, including St. John's Anglican Church. Its first cornerstone was laid in 1816 to serve as the first mission outpost of Toronto's St. James Cathedral. Nearly two centuries later, it continues to serve the York Mills community.",Towns and Villages,/Pages/York_Mills3.html

Twenty-three metres high, this is the steepest part of the old bluffs running through the city just below St. Clair Avenue. All of Toronto below this point was once under water. An Indian trail connecting the Don and Humber Rivers wound its way along the foot of the hill. This shore line eventually became Davenport Road. These steep bluffs hampered the northward movement of early settlers. But as settlement progressed, much of the shorecliff was tamed and re-graded. A string of fine homes was built along its crest. In spite of these changes, the bluffs retained much of their imposing beauty. In 1913 a stairway was built on the Spadina Road alignment replacing an earlier wooden stairs. In recent times, this site was threatened by a proposal for a Spadina Expressway, with a tunnel beginning just below St. Clair Avenue, and exiting out of this hillside into a sweeping interchange. In 1971, the expressway was halted by the organized efforts of local residents. The Toronto Transit Commission's Spadina subway line was built deep beneath this site in 1980. The land on which the Baldwin Steps are located is now owned by the Province of Ontario and was leased back to the City of Toronto in 1984 for 99 years.

Here's what the plaques say: The Humber River's first rapids, at Bloor Street, have long kept boats from navigating far up the river. Below those rapids, however, boating has been an important aspect of the Humber's history. For centuries, Aboriginal peoples approached the beginning of the Toronto Carrying Place near here in bark canoes - their remarkable craft that were quickly adopted by early Europeans. In the late 1670s, canoes were joined by French sailing ships that unloaded goods to be transported along the portage or, after 1720, to supply the French trading post at Toronto. In the 1790s, with British settlement and the establishment of water-powered mills, a growing number of vessels were moving supplies and produce up and down the river below the first rapids. Around 1800, a shipyard existed on this side of the Humber, just south of Bloor, that produced sailing ships - including one named Toronto. After the mid-19th century, commercial shipping was gradually replaced by recreational boating. Boathouses and marinas were built on the Humber's lower banks, and crowds would gather along the shore to watch boat races. Today, boats can still be launched near here, perhaps just a few steps from where Aboriginal peoples and European traders used to push their canoes into the river.",Transportation,/Pages/Boating_on_the_Humber_River.html

After his death in 1826, the Smith tract was divided into concessions and the names O'Connor, Sandford, Horner, Evans and Brown are prominent on early maps of the area. Joseph Brown emigrated from Yorkshire, England in 1831 and shortly after his arrival he became the first permanent settler, establishing a farm on Concession III, just north of what is now Evans Avenue.

Completed in 1919, the Locomotive Shop's symmetrical features, tall windows, and shallow buttresses were typical of engine house design. Each engine was moved to one of 12 service bays by the transfer table, which was shared with the Passenger Car Repair Shop to the east.With the opening, in 1927, of yards and shops at Spadina Avenue, west of Union Station, the Leaside Terminal declined in importance. The Locomotive Shop closed in the early 1930s. The building was then acquired by E. S. & A. Robinson, which used it as part of their package factory until 1954.

Here's what it tells us: It's a crisp late winter day in March, 1935. Since late last night, Canadian Pacific's Hudson 2815 has been drowsing in the steamy warmth of Toronto's John Street roundhouse, while the shop forces deal with the myriad tasks of servicing and light maintenance in preparation for the H1b's next passenger service assignment. Both the locomotive and shop are just five years old.And despite the Great Depression, railways are the preferred mode of inter-city travel for Canadians, from coast to coast. John Street boasts Canada's first installation of a Direct Steaming system. This means that locomotives laying over between runs can be maintained under shop steam without a fire on the grates. When the engine arrived last evening, 2815's fire was dropped completely, a layer of fresh coal was placed on the grates and the engine rolled into its stall on the steam pressure remaining in the boiler. Once in the roundhouse, it was connected through its blow-off valve to the Direct Steaming system.Now, 2815 is marked up for train 37, due to depart Toronto Union Station at 5:20 pm for Windsor.

Here's what it says: Crawford Street passes through Trinity Bellwoods Park over a graceful triple-span concrete bridge which still exists, but is now buried beneath the street. The bridge once crossed a ravine carved by Garrison Creek as it flowed from north of St. Clair Avenue into Lake Ontario near Fort York. Crawford Street was first extended over the ravine on a wooden bridge in 1884. In 1914 and 1915, R.C. Harris, Commissioner of Works, had the old bridge replaced with one made of concrete. (A visionary, Harris was responsible for the Bloor Street Viaduct, 1918.) The bridge's spans, railings, and lampposts captured Harris's flair for dramatic public architecture. Both Garrison Creek and the Crawford Street Bridge now lie hidden beneath this park. By the 1880s, the creek was so polluted that it was gradually channelled underground into a brick sewer, built through here in 1885. Portions of the ravine were then filled in, here with earth from subway excavation in the 1960s. The bridge was buried up to its sidewalks and roadbed, and its railing and lampposts were removed. In 2004, the original sidewalks and roadbed were entirely rebuilt, but the remainder of the bridge rests intact beneath the surface.",Transportation,/Pages/Crawford_Street_Bridge.html

The ancient shore remains as an escarpment overlooking the plain on which Toronto is built. Native peoples beat a path at the base of this ridge to use as an overland route between the Humber and Don rivers. French explorers and missionaries followed the trail to and from Huronia. After the founding of York in 1793, the trail began to appear on maps of the area. The name commemorates the first house built on top of the ridge in 1797, John McGill's ""Davenport"".

Rail lines were first built through this area in the 1850s, connecting Toronto to the upper Great Lakes and points in-between. By the 1880s, multiple tracks had been constructed to carry passengers and freight to destinations such as London and Chicago and, eventually, to the edges of the continent. Rail traffic was busy enough to cause lengthy stops and dangerous crossings for pedestrians and horse-drawn vehicles travelling between the City of Toronto and the Town of Parkdale. Designed by Charles Sproatt, a City of Toronto engineer, this underpass succeeded in solving the traffic problem, and was an important structure in the development of Toronto's rail and road system.",Transportation,/Pages/King_Street_West_Railway.html

Here's what it says: In 1875 the Kingston Road Tramway opened a horsecar line between the Don River and Main St., extended in 1878 to Blantyre Ave. Operations ceased in 1887. On July 1, 1893 the Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power commenced operating an electric street railway or ""Radial Car"" line from Queen St. East to Blantyre Ave. Until 1897 the line continued down Blantyre Ave. to the Victoria Park. In 1898 the route was relaid eastward to the Hunt Club; extended to the Halfway House at Midland Ave. in 1901; to Scarborough P.O. at Eglinton Ave. in 1905; and to West Hill in 1906. The line became the Scarboro' division of the Toronto & York Radial Railways in 1904. The T.T.C. city streetcar service replaced the radial cars to Victoria Park Ave. in 1921 and to Birchmount in 1928. The West Hill extension was abandoned in 1930. Finally, the line between Birchmount and Eglinton ceased operation on June 26, 1936. The passenger stops were originally numbered from Queen Street, then renumbered from Victoria Park Ave. in 1922. These numbers, such as; Stop 14 (Halfway House), Stop 17 (Scarborough High School) and Stop 26 (Scarborough P.O.), were common reference points, kept in use until the 1960's.",Transportation,/Pages/Kingston_Road_Radial.html

This monument was erected in the median of the highway where it began at the Humber River. In the mid-70s, due to widening of the highway, the monument was moved to its present location, in parkland just south of the highway. This 1975 Toronto Historical Board plaque is attached to the monument. As well, there is a message cut into the stone on the north side under the lion. (Note; Wayne Adam reports that the plaque is missing as of July 2018, and possibly earlier.) Here's what the plaque says: This monument marked the eastern entrance to the Queen Elizabeth Way, opened in 1939 by Her Majesty Elizabeth, the Queen Consort, in the company of His Majesty, King George VI. It was designed by W.L. Somerville, Architect, and Frances Loring, Sculptor. Florence Wyle assisted in modelling the royal profiles and the crown.

Here's what it says: George Cooper donated land for Davenport Station, located at Davenport Road on Station Street (now, Caledonia Park Road) for Ontario's first railway, Ontario, Simcoe & Huron. The first passenger train operated over this line from downtown Toronto to Machell's Corners (Aurora) in 1853.Sometimes referred to as Oats, Straw & Hay, farmers were able to transport their crops to various regions. Though rail provided local employment, the industry went through booms and busts. OS&H became Northern Railway of Canada (1858), Grand Trunk Railway (1888) and then was taken over by the federal government's Canadian National Railways in 1923.Rail also influenced great improvements in civil engineering, especially bridges and tunnels. CNR built an elevated crossing over St. Clair Avenue West in 1931 at the same time replacing Davenport Station with St. Clair Station. The bridge was built to the latest technology at the time, fixed-frame reinforced concrete and it was completed in 72 hours! St. Clair Station was used until 1982 before being lost to fires and neglect.",Transportation,/Pages/Local_Rail.html

Here's what it tells us: The first railway crossing over the Don River was built here in 1856 as part of the Grand Trunk Railway's main line between Toronto and Montreal. This rail link was vital to industry and commerce, connecting Canada's two largest cities in laying the foundation for Toronto's rapid growth as a major economic centre. In 1892, the Grand Trunk built a new bridge utilizing the original 1856 abutments. The remains of the original eastern bridge abutment can be seen on the opposite riverbank. The current elevated track for the Canadian National Railway was built as part of the grade separation, completed in 1930, which raised the railroad above the streets to allow safer public access to the lakefront south of here. In 2007, the Don River was widened in this location for flood-control purposes. The stones from the original 1856 abutment were redistributed as informal seating and as part of the retaining wall for the railway underpass connecting the West Don Lands with the Don Watershed Trail.",Transportation,/Pages/Lower_Don_River_Railway_Crossing.html

Over the years her distinguished passengers have included: the Duke Of York (1901); Edward, Prince Of Wales (1919); Philip, Duke Of Edinburgh (1983) and Charles, Prince Of Wales (1992). Originally manually coal-fired and steam-powered, though later converted to diesel (1950), Hiawatha remains true to her original appearance, which is typical of a late 19th century launch, having a narrow hull, a plumb stem and a counter stern. Her romantic name was inspired by the Longfellow poem ""Song of Hiawatha"" and the native street names of the Toronto Island.

Here's what the plaque tells us: In the first half of the 20th century, Manitou Road was the main commercial street of Centre Island. Originally known as Middle Road, it became an increasingly important thoroughfare with the construction in 1905 of a freight wharf near the bridge over Long Pond. To serve a growing population of both summer and year-round residents, business along the road expanded in the following decade to include a general store, a butcher shop, a dairy, a boathouse, laundries, and several hotels. Manitou Road also became an entertainment hub with facilities that included a casino, a bowling alley, and a movie theatre.In 1956, Metropolitan Toronto Council expropriated Centre Island for the creation of Toronto Island Park. Many of the businesses were demolished and Manitou Road was replaced by a concrete pedestrian walkway.

Due to complaints about the road, Danforth had considerable difficulty collecting his money, the land grants promised to his labourers were deferred, and he returned to the United States a disappointed and embittered man. However, while the government officially called the road Dundas Street after a secretary of state in the Imperial government, it soon became generally known as Danforth Road, a name which it still retains in western Scarborough.

This 1998 plaque, erected by the York Local Architectural Conservation Advisory Committee on the south side of Dundas Street West just east of Scarlett Road, gives us some information: Established as a toll road under the Turnpike Act of 1833, this road, now Dundas Street, was the primary route for commerce and stage coach travel between Toronto and South Western Ontario. Money paid by travellers was to pay for the upkeep of the road. This was the site of Toll Gate House number Five. Tolls were charged for each horse and rider, hog, cow or sheep driven along the road, and each wagon depending on the load and whether drawn by one horse or two. There was no charge for funerals or going to church on Sunday and no toll for the military.

The viaduct joined Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue from Sherbourne Street to Broadview Avenue, to provide easy access to the rapidly expanding suburbs east of the Don River. The Bloor section, carried on an earthen embankment, stretches eastward from Sherbourne to Parliament Streets. The Don section, supported by a bridge 494 metres long, extends westward from Broadview Avenue. The Rosedale section, with a bridge span of 177 metres, forms a connecting link between them. On the recommendation of Jacob and Davies, Consulting Engineers, provision for a lower second deck was incorporated into the viaduct to carry subway trains.

Here's what it says: Yorkville has been a vital centre for public transit for more than 150 years. The first transit, in 1849, was a horse-drawn omnibus service owned by cabinetmaker and carriage builder H. Burt Williams. His vehicles carried passengers and mail on a fixed route between St. Lawrence Hall, at King and Jarvis Streets, and the Red Lion Inn, at Yonge and Bloor Streets. The inn was a landmark in the independent Village of Yorkville.In 1861, the City of Toronto awarded the Toronto Street Railway a franchise to build and run the city's first streetcar line. These first streetcars were horse-drawn, built in Philadelphia, USA, and decorated with images of Toronto landmarks. The line, tracing the route of Williams' bus service, contributed to Yorkville's growth. Toronto annexed Yorkville in 1883.The streetcar lines were electrified in the 1890s. The Yonge streetcar line became the busiest in the city, prompting construction of Canada's first subway. Operated by the publicly owned Toronto Transit Commission, it opened in 1954. Completion of the first phase of the Bloor-Danforth line in 1966 confirmed Yorkville's position as a hub for public transit in Toronto.",Transportation,/Pages/Public_Transit_in_Yorkville.html

Here's what the plaques say: Ancient trails have long merged where the mouth of the Humber River meets the shore of Lake Ontario. In the 1850s, footpaths and wagon roads were joined by railway tracks. Toronto's first railway, the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway served the same purpose as the Carrying Place trail, the ancient portage route up the Humber River - they both carried trade goods and people overland to connect Lake Ontario with the upper Great Lakes. Only a few years later, the first railway tracks along the lakeshore were laid here, in 1855 for the Hamilton and Toronto Railway. As a result, the landscape at this location was again altered by the construction of a viaduct to carry trains over the river. The railways on the viaduct above have carried generations of passengers, and tonnes of freight, to and from such places as Windsor, Niagara Falls, and New York City. Since 1967, they have also carried GO Train passengers. Today, this rail corridor - near the beginning of an ancient portage route - is one of the busiest in Canada.",Transportation,/Pages/Railways_Over_the_Humber.html

Photos of the memorials are further down this page. This Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto plaque commemorating the bridge is located beside a parking lot off Raymore Drive. Here's what the plaque says: As dawn broke on Thursday October 14, 1954, Hurricane Hazel reached Southern Ontario after lashing the eastern United States. By midnight Friday, October 15, an estimated 209 mm of rain had fallen, creating massive floods throughout Metro. The resulting damage was severe. Just upstream, flood waters tore loose a footbridge that crossed the Humber River. The river rose 6 metres, sweeping away 14 homes on Raymore Drive and killing 32 residents in one hour.  After Hurricane Hazel, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was established to promote watershed management and public ownership of the floodplain. Raymore Park was then dedicated in memory of Hurricane Hazel's many victims and survivors. In 1995, a new footbridge was constructed by Metro Toronto with support from the Province of Ontario, representing a substantial step towards the completion of the Humber Trail and greenway system.",Transportation,/Pages/Raymore_Bridge.html

Renamed Riverdale Station in 1907, the building stood here on De Grassi Street at Queen Street East. It's dramatic turret, bay window, and a deep overhanging roof were defining features typical of small railway stations of the period.In 1904, a streetcar collided with a freight train at the level crossing on Queen Street East, killing three people and injuring 18. This and subsequent accidents led to the elevation of the new Union Station railway corridor above city streets and sidewalks.

Here's what the plaques say: The array of traffic lanes at the mouth of the Humber River began with an Aboriginal footpath, formed along the lakeshore thousands of years ago. By 1798, a wider wagon path had been cleared to become the Lake Shore Road - a vital link between new settlements along Lake Ontario.In the early 1800s, travellers along the Lake Shore Road crossed the Humber River by ferry. A log viaduct was constructed in 1824, then replaced by a swing bridge in the 1840s. With the decline of shipping on the river in the 1850s, the swing bridge was replaced by a fixed bridge. In 1893, an adjacent second bridge allowed electric streetcars also to cross the river.Automobiles changed the landscape yet again. The vehicular crossing here was widened in 1931, then dramatically altered in the 1950s with the construction of the Gardiner Expressway and The Queensway.

1082,43.666634,-79.403697,Spadina Expressway,"This set of three historical plaques, erected by Heritage Toronto in 2010, is located here at the southeast corner of Spadina Avenue and Bloor Street. A set of three plaques identical to these three can be found further north outside the Dupont Subway Station on the northwest corner of Spadina Avenue and Dupont Street. Here's what they tell us: Spadina ExpresswayIn the 1960s, this stretch of Spadina Road was to be transformed into the southern end of a sunken, four- to six-lane expressway and a subway line. They would connect downtown Toronto with Highway 401, but the expressway would require the destruction of neighbourhoods and parkland along its route. The Spadina Expressway and subway line were one part of a much larger plan to manage traffic congestion in and around Toronto. Already part of the City's master plan in 1943, new ""superhighways"" responded to projections of dramatic suburban growth and the increasing use of the automobile to bring commuters to and from downtown. Shortly after the formation of the Municipality Metropolitan Toronto in 1953, construction of a system of expressways began with the Gardiner Expressway. Metropolitan Toronto Council approved the Spadina Expressway and subway line in 1962.

""Stop Spadina Save Our City""For many people, the Spadina Expressway was necessary for Toronto to adapt to modern needs. For others, it promised only the destruction of homes and parks, more traffic congestion, and pollutants from automobile exhaust. Citizen-led efforts against the expressway grew into the ""Stop Spadina Save Our City Coordinating Committee"" in 1969. This committee argued that the negative impact of the expressway and its soaring costs were not justified by a faster drive to and from downtown Toronto - itself a short-term gain because increasing traffic from suburban and urban growth would soon overwhelm and clog the expressway. The committee argued instead for better public transit. The Stop Spadina committee could not convince Metropolitan Toronto Council to cancel the expressway, and then lost a legal challenge in 1970 to cut off funding for its completion. A final appeal to the Government of Ontario, however, was a stunning success. Amidst great controversy, Premier William Davis cancelled the Spadina Expressway on June 3, 1971.

After the Spadina ExpresswayThe cancellation of the Spadina Expressway in 1971 left a section completed from Wilson Avenue in the north to Lawrence Avenue in the south. Now known as the William R. Allen Road, the expressway was opened to Eglinton Avenue in 1976, while the Spadina subway line was completed along the planned route of the expressway in 1978. The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway project was a landmark in the development of the City of Toronto. It signalled the end to plans for the other expressways which were to be cut through existing neighbourhoods. The Stop Spadina movement also helped give a voice to citizens in the planning of their neighbourhoods, and encouraged greater respect for the historic urban fabric during a period of intense redevelopment. Newly elected municipal politicians influenced by the Spadina Expressway fight and other movements of civic activism would shape the City of Toronto in the 1970s.",Transportation,/Pages/Spadina_Expressway1.html

Here's what it says: The Spadina Expressway was planned to run from Wilson Avenue in the north, through the Cedarvale-Nordheimer Ravine and the Casa Loma escarpment to Bloor Street in the south. It was designed in the 1940s as a commuter facility in an era when people were expected to live in the suburbs and work downtown, and it was controversial from the beginning. It was completed south to Lawrence Avenue by 1966. By the late 1960s, opposition became so intense that ""Stop Spadina"" became a rallying cry. The effective end of the Spadina came on June 3rd 1971 when the Hon William G. Davis, then Premier of Ontario, announced in the legislature that ""If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.""",Transportation,/Pages/Spadina_Expressway2.html
1084,43.681173,-79.428182,Streetcar Suburb,"Attached to this eastbound St. Clair Avenue West transit shelter at Arlington Avenue is this City of Toronto plaque. Here's what it says: On ribbons of steel and a streak of chained lightning, Toronto's transportation destiny arrived with its first electric streetcars in 1892. ""Riding the witch's broom,"" it was called. And just as the newfangled elevator made the city grow skyward, the streetcar made it grow outward, far beyond the limits of the quaint horse-drawn streetcars of old.As those streetcars reached out of the old city, a new one was born. Where once there were fields and farmhouses, new neighbourhoods arose, replete with houses, stores, office, theatres and parks. Streetcar suburbs, they were called.In 1913, the streetcars of the publicly-owned Toronto Civic Railways bestowed their spark of life on this one: St. Clair West. Today, both the streetcars and the neighbourhood they created remain vibrant, inviting and intertwined.

1085,43.644514,-79.382232,The Teamway,"On the west side of York Street, a few steps south of Station Street, in a pedestrian tunnel, facing south, can be seen this plaque. Here's what it tells us: You are walking through the Teamway, now a pedestrian passageway running along the west side of the York Street ""subway"" or tunnel and underneath the railway viaduct. In earlier days, goods arriving by train at Union Station were unloaded and transferred to the Canadian National Express Building, a depot for transshipment, located above and beside where you are now standing. Here, horse-drawn wagons picked up the items from teamways or loading bays for delivery.Owing to the decline in rail traffic in the last decade, many of the tracks in the Railway Lands have been removed. This has opened up the area for new development. In 1995, nearly half of the York Street subway was demolished. The renovation of the Teamway began in 1997 as part of the York Street Gateway Project, a joint venture involving the federal and provincial governments (Canada/Ontario Infrastructure Works), the City of Toronto and Marathon Developments Inc., to improve pedestrian connections between Toronto's downtown and its harbourfront.The area between Front Street and the harbourfront has changed significantly during the course of local history. At one time, the shoreline of Lake Ontario was at Front Street. With the founding of the Town of York (Toronto) in 1793, came European settlement and the development of the waterfront. By the 1840s, much of the original beach along the shoreline had been replaced by piers constructed for passengers and cargo ships. By the 1850s, there was also considerable development of railways in Toronto. The Esplanade Act of 1853 granted the right-of-way along the shore to the Grand Trunk Railway, which proceeded to fill in this area to provide land for tracks. Thus began the southward expansion of land into the lake. The construction of privately owned wharfs also continued, and the shoreline gradually moved southward until, by 1900, it was more then 300 metres (984 feet) south of its original line. Starting in 1913, a further southward expansion was undertaken by the Toronto Harbour Commissioners. The location of Toronto's shoreline today is a result of the THC's ongoing lakefilling activities.In the early days, as now, the railway tracks divided the central business district of Toronto from the waterfront. In order to help solve the problem of pedestrians having to cross the tracks at grade level, a bridge was constructed at York Street in 1896/97. By 1909, the Dominion Board of Railway Commissioners had ordered the construction of a railway viaduct, thus allowing people and vehicles to move under the railway tracks through subways. However, disagreements delayed completion until 1931. The York Street Bridge was dismantled in 1927 to make way for the present day Union Station, and the York Street subway was opened in 1931. At 213 metres (700 feet), it was the longest subway in Toronto.Teamway ArtworkThe artwork in this pedestrian passageway reflects the evolution of the Teamway from the shores of Lake Ontario to Union Station.

Trillium was privately owned by the Toronto Ferry Company until 1926 when ferry service became the responsibility of the municipal government. Steam-powered ferries were gradually replaced with modern diesel vessels and in 1956, Trillium was officially retired.

1095,43.642023,-79.374633,Yonge Street 1796,"There's a belief in this city that Yonge Street is the 'Longest Street in the World', running from Toronto all the way to Rainy River near the Manitoba border. Bunk! Not true! A myth! Here's the true story. Yonge Street runs from Toronto's lakeshore almost as straight as an arrow north to its end in Holland Marsh almost at Lake Simcoe: a total of 58 km. What happened, I think, to get the myth going was that Ontario Highway 11 used to also begin at Toronto's lakeshore and, over the years, the two, Yonge Street and Highway 11, became almost synonymous in people's minds. Highway 11 does run all the way to Rainy River; Highway 11, not Yonge Street. By the way, in the late 1990s the Conservative government cut back on its highway network, turning many highways and parts of highways over to municipalities. As a result Highway 11 no longer starts in Toronto. Its southern end is now Barrie. I took this photo standing on the south side of Queen's Quay looking north at the very beginning of the 58 km long Yonge Street. That's the Toronto Star building on the right, in front of which is this Ontario Heritage Trust plaque which reads: The shortest route between the upper and lower Great Lakes lies between here and Georgian Bay. For John Graves Simcoe, Upper Canada first lieutenant-governor, this protected inland passage had strategic military and commercial potential. He founded York (Toronto) in 1793, then ordered a road built to replace native trails which led north to Lake Simcoe and its water links with Lake Huron. Completed on February 16, 1796, it was named after British Secretary for War Sir George Yonge, an expert on Roman roads. Yonge Street developed from a muddy, stump-riddled forest trail into the main street of Toronto and the first part of Highway 11, which now extends 1,896 kilometres to Rainy River.",Transportation,/Pages/Yonge_Street.html

Considered among our finest poets, Isabella Crawford was born in Ireland and came to Canada with her parents about 1858. After settling first in Paisley, Ontario, the family lived later in Lakefield and Peterborough. As a young woman Isabella became fascinated by backwoods life and Indian legends. Following her father's death, she and her mother moved to Toronto. There they subsisted on her meagre earnings from light verse and 'formula fiction' that appeared in Canadian and American newspapers. One privately-printed book of serious poetry, 'Old Spookeses Pass, Malcom's Katie and Other Poems' appeared before her untimely death at 57 John Street. Full recognition came later, however, with the publication of her collected poems, which were admired for their evocative images of the lush and sparkling wilderness.'Darkness built its wigwam walls close around the camp'",Women,/Pages/Isabella_Valancy_Crawford.html

In 1958 she joined the East York Township Council and was elected its first female Reeve in 1960. In 1967 she led a spirited and successful defense against amalgamation into Toronto. East York was instead merged with Leaside to form the new Borough of East York and elected her as its first Mayor. Her term in office was marked by the belief that a community's quality of life was created by the activities of its citizens, rather then buildings and public works alone. Her philosophy was shown in her ability to inspire and attract intelligent and dedicated people to serve their community, both on municipal boards and committees. A firm believer in the promotion and preservation of community culture and heritage, she founded and served as first Director of the East York Foundation and through that body created the Todmorden Mills museum as a community sponsored Centennial project in 1967. In 1969, during her final term on Council, she was elected by her peers as President of the Association of Mayors and Reeves of Ontario. True was a founding member of the Canadian Federation of University Women; she received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto and York University; was awarded the Order of Canada and the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal.
