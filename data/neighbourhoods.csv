Hamilton Townsend was OAA president, opposed to TorontoÂ´s Architectural Eighteen Club Reference, Contract Record, volume 14, Sept 1903

It was determined that the architect for no. 138 Madison, was Hamilton
Townsend, not Jocelyn Davidson as attributed by Patricia McHugh who also mistakenly named the house Rivermead. McHughâs information conflicts with the
1903 Contract Record [Toronto], vol. Xiv, 16 September 1903, which indicates the
house at 138 Madison as designed by architect S.H. Townsend. Gardiner descendants cleared the confusion. The Gardiner family did live at 138 Madison Avenue, but Rivermead was the name of the family weekend property in Weston, designed by Jocelyn Davidson.",Arts and Crafts,Annex (95)

character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed as an industrial area in the early
20th century.

piers which are channelled through the first floor and unadorned in the other stories. Window
openings have been altered in the first floor on the north wall and in the second storey on the east

that are banded at the base, in the lower stories, and near the flat roof. The main entrance is
placed at street level in the left (west) bay beside two commercial windows. The upper four
floors feature rows of segmental-headed window openings with stone sills. A corbelled brick

The school was named after the famous medieval Italian poet, Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), the author of the epic poem, “The Divine Comedy”.
 
The Dante Alighieri Academy of 1974 consisted of 180 students, nine teachers, a relocatable and two portables. In 1976 a permanent building was completed and by 1979 the final addition was completed.
 
Through the years, Dante Alighieri Academy has offered a wide range of programs at the advanced and general levels. The school is also the centre of studies for TCDSB's deaf and hard of hearing students.
 
In 2005, Global Architects Inc added a 10,000sf arts pavilion addition to the high school’s existing facility to meet the new arts focused curriculum. The addition features two wings – one for performing arts and one for visual arts. Each wing consists of an open studio environment that can be divisible into smaller focus areas. The performing arts wing includes spaces for vocal and instrumental music and drama. In its open format, the space acts as a 300-seat performance space complete with an elevated stage.
The project also features passive solar control measures such as horizontal sunscreens and expansive roof overhangs.
In 2017, CS&P Architects and partners unveiled the design for the new shared-use facility for the Columbus Centre/Villa Charities and Dante Alighieri Academy Redevelopment. The new intergenerational community hub is considered the largest and only co-development project of its kind currently underway in North America, and will better meet the needs and expectations of future generations and the communities they serve.",Contemporary,Yorkdale-Glen Park (31)

the 19th century. The heritage attributes of the building are found on the exterior walls and roof with attention
focused on the principal (east) faÃ§ade and the side elevations (north and south). The two-storey
dwelling, clad with red brick and trimmed with yellow brick, incorporates the polychromy and
stylistic details favoured in the mid-19th century Gothic Revival style. The building is covered
by a medium-pitched gable roof with double attached end chimneys. On the east facade, the two
units are divided visually by quoining, a motif which is repeated on the corners of the firebreak
walls. On each three-bay section, the main entrance is placed above grade in the right bay beside
two flat-headed openings with characteristic multi-paned windows. Above a string course
running the width of the building, flat-headed window openings are slightly reduced in height

As the population grew, the community (lead by parents and teachers) began to lobby for an addition to replace the portables. After many years of hard work and persistence, they were successful.

The original location of the cabin was near where Queen St. crosses the Don Valley Parkway. A plaque erected in 2003 by the Riverdale Historical Society marks the original building.
John Scadding (1754-1824), secretary to Governor John Graves, came to York (Toronto) in 1793. Simcoe granted him 250 acres on the east bank of Don River, south of Kingston Road. It was on this land that the cabin was constructed, built by the Queen’s Rangers in 1794. It is a two-story, square-timbered construction from hewn logs.
Scadding returned to England in 1796 and upon returning to York in 1818, sold the cabin and part of his land to William Smith Jr. The Smith’s used it as an outbuilding for their farm.
In August 1879, owner John Smith donated the building to the York Pioneers. The group dismantled the building, transported it, and rebuilt it on the Industrial Exhibition grounds (now the Canadian National Exhibition). It is not known how the building was transported to its current site, although some suggest it may have been floated down the Don River and along the shoreline of Lake Ontario. On August 22, 1879 the York Pioneers rebuilt the cabin and, according to newspapers, were finished by 5pm. The cabin was opened as a museum and is still open every day during the CNE.
In 1909, the cabin’s interior and exterior were whitewashed, a practice that continued regularly until the 1950s. While the exterior is no longer white, the interior logs remain so. In 1959, a cement sub-floor was created for the cabin to sit upon.
The cabin was designated a heritage building by the City of Toronto in 1989. As the property is over 200 years old, its condition had deteriorated over time. Heather & Little were hired to replace the cedar shingle roofing. The team worked to make the replacement shingles as historically accurate as possible; #1 Blue Label Western Cedar Shingles were used. At the same time, masonry repairs on the chimney were completed by Colonial Building Restoration of Toronto.
The building had often been referred to as ‘Simcoe’s Cabin,’ perhaps because of a misunderstanding of the original occupant. The building’s current name- Scadding Cabin- is in honour of Henry Scadding (John Scadding’s son), who was a founding member and president of the York Pioneer Historical Society. A plaque detailing the history of the cabin was erected in 2012 by Heritage Toronto at the cabin’s current site.",Log construction,Niagara (82)

Ketchum had previously donated land in 1832 for a school which was built at McMurrich Street and Davenport Road. Overflow from this original 1832 school meant that girls were taught across the street at Ketchum Hall, a Temperance Hall built by Ketchum. 

In 1856, he donated the land for the current site to build a âFree and Common School.â In 1858, a four-roomed school was built on the site and accommodated both male and female students. However, soon overcrowding became an issue and Ketchum Hall was once again used for overflow. 

In 1875, two rooms were added, and in 1878 a three-story addition was built. Yorkville Trustees bought the land to the west of the school to use as a playground. In 1883, Yorkville was annexed to Toronto and the Board voted to rename the school âJesse Ketchum School.â In 1889, the first two-room addition (from 1875) was replaced with 8 rooms. A fire in 1904 destroyed part of the additions, but the main building was largely undamaged. 

Construction on the current building began in 1915 but was delayed due to the First World War. In 1917, the Recruits Deport of the Royal Flying Corps used the school building as a barracks, and the neighbouring park as a parade and sports ground. The building returned to school use in 1920.

In 1958, the school accommodated approximately 1000 students in 31 rooms. That year, a major expansion was built upon the 1915 building, which added a gymnasium, assembly room, art room, science room, cafeteria, music room, speech and drama room, and new lighting. The formal opening of the renovated school occurred on September 29, 1958.

The former War Amps building has design value as a rare example of a headquarters-manufacturing building designed to integrate a cenotaph-like element in the Modern Classicism style. Favoured by public institutions and conservative corporations, Modern Classicism was applied to this building designed for the employment of Canadian war amputees manufacturing their key tags and for their national headquarters.

The design value is evident in the high degree of artistic merit seen in the combination of minimal and linear classical details, traditional materials such as limestone cladding, modern materials and elements such as polished black granite, curtain walling and the cast metal handrails which exhibit the combined influence of Streamlined Art Deco and 1950s automobile styling. Further, the tall, single, limestone-clad fluted pier at the west end of the principal (south) elevation of the building has a quality evocative of a cenotaph, appropriate in honouring the sacrifice made by the war amputees in service to their country. The building with its highly visible cenotaph-like stone pier, originally displaying the War Amps emblem, is set back and viewed across the open space in front of the building and on approach from Yonge Street.

The property has associative value with the War Amps organization, founded in 1918 by veteran amputee and army padre Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Lambert, O. B. E. (1886-1971), who remained the president of War Amps until his death and was a persistent advocate for veterans. To honour him, the former Christie Street Military hospital was re-named Lambert Lodge. The War Amps received its charter in 1920 as an organization of ""amputees helping amputees"" with both practical assistance and counselling. Their now nation-wide, key tag service was initiated in 1946 as a means for veterans to achieve independence through employment. The War Amps has expanded their services to include adults and children who have lost their limbs from causes other than war.

The property is also valued for its association with the Toronto architect Charles B. Dolphin (1888-1969), known for many fine landmark buildings in the city including the Postal Delivery Building (1939-1941).

Contextually, the War Amps building is valued as it contributes to maintaining the mid-century character and low-rise scale of the buildings fronting onto the north side of Merton Street between Yonge Street and Pailton Crescent. The building is historically linked to its surroundings as it was part of post-war transformation and re-development of the street following the completion of the Yonge Street subway line.",Modern classical,Mount Pleasant West (104)

Originally, the parish was to be named after St. Charles. According to historical records, however, the first school--a small wooden structure--was named St. Mary's.
In 1890, the school was replaced with a brick building and renamed St. Cecilia's. Legend has it that St. Cecilia, the patron saint of sacred music, was chosen as the new name because the Heintzman Piano factory stood in view, across the railway tracks, from the school. The present St. Cecilia's Church, at the corner of Annette Street and Pacific Avenue, was opened in 1909, replacing a smaller structure first occupied in 1895. Father Eugene Gallagher was the pastor.
The present St. Cecilia Catholic School, at the corner of Annette Street and Evelyn Avenue, opened in 1914 with additions in 1918, 1954 and 1964. The school's first teachers and administrators were the Loretto Nuns, who lived in the former Heintzman family residence at Annette and Laws Streets, providing another musical connection with St. Cecilia.",Modernist,High Park North (88)

The actual street address was 380 Mortimer Avenue. The original one-storey brick schoolhouse, which used an estimated 55,000 bricks and 6,200 floor tiles, had its official opening on April 12, 1944. The building consisted of four classrooms, office and two cloakrooms; an auditorium and two teachers’ lunch rooms were on the basement level. The new address was 299A Donlands Avenue beside Holy Cross Church.
An addition was made in 1948. This second-storey consisted of four classrooms, a lunchroom for the lay teachers, a nurse’s office, a sewing room, and a sitting room. The two classes that had been in the auditorium were moved upstairs.
In 1949, a Kindergarten-primary class was begun. In 1954, on November 22nd, a new portable was opened on the school property to accommodate twenty-seven Grade 3 pupils. By 1961, there were 4 portables on the property.
On January 23, 1963, the Toronto Metropolitan Separate School Board received tentative approval for the addition of ten classrooms (replacement of four) at a proposed cost of $200,000 and excavations began during the Easter holiday period.
In September of 1963, school opened with an enrolment of 635 students and a staff of twenty-one teachers. Construction of the new wing was not yet completed. In October, eight classes moved into the new addition, but the basement rooms weren’t yet ready and teachers had to make do, since no teachers’ desks or chairs had arrived. 
An Open House and Blessing of the new wing by Father Miller was held on Sunday, March 1st, 1964. But construction was not quite finished! In June of 1966, plans were submitted for the “Phase 2 Addition” to the school, which was to include two more classrooms, a library and a general purpose room. The budget was $125,000. The Government of Ontario gave the School Board a grant of $80,000 towards the cost. The addition was completed in 1967.",Modernist,Danforth East York (59)

This original school was replaced in 1870 by a one room schoolhouse, known as School Section No. 20, on the site of the present-day school. This one-room schoolhouse was in use until 1895. After a new school opened in 1896, the one-room schoolhouse was used for public meetings. In 1904 it was sold to St. Johnâs Norway Church and transported down Kingston Road to be converted into a rectory. 

A Trustees Meeting in 1896 established that a new, two-story school building was needed. A competition was opened for plans for a new building; J.W. Malloryâs design was selected and built at a cost of $4000. When the 1896 school building opened, there were approximately 100 students.

July 1903: Increased enrollment required two rooms to be added to the north side of the building. By 1906, enrollment was at 243 students and the school was once again overcrowded. 

1910: 8 rooms added, becoming the east and west wings. Contractors for this addition substituted subpar building materials (for example, spruce and hemlock in place of pine and oak) to save money, something they did for several other schools. 

1913: Kindergarten began at Norway Public School.

1919: Building had 14 rooms and a portable, with an enrollment of 711 students. 

1920: 881 students. âNorway Annexâ addition added to the west of main building at a cost of $120 000. This included 6 new classrooms, subject-specific rooms, and kindergarten rooms. Later additions in 1922 and 1929 added more rooms. A proposed addition of pool, locker room, and shower room was abandoned due to budget constraints.
 
1931: Building contained 26 rooms and portables to accommodate 1142 students. 

1942: A fire destroyed the second floor of the main (1896) building. This floor was not rebuilt. 

In the 1970s, parents, teachers, and trustees lobbied the Board of Education to replace the old school buildings rather than eliminate the school. The new, current school building was officially opened on April 15, 1977.",Postmodern,East End-Danforth (62)

Allen, Auxiliary Bishop for the Archdiocese of Toronto from 1954 until his death in 1972. Bishop Allen was a man known for his firm commitment and support of Catholic education. Our community strives to express his vision of Catholic education, one that is rich in intellectual tradition and is relevant and powerful in its social message. Bishop Allen Academy is situated on 14½ acres on a beautiful ravine that runs parallel to the Mimico Creek. This property was part of the original piece of land surveyed in the township of Etobicoke in 1793 which was set aside for the use of the government mill or the King's Mill which was located at the first rapids upstream from Lake Ontario. In 1961 the Etobicoke Board of Education decided on this site for the building of a high school, Kingsmill Vocational School, which housed 500 student.In 1989 it was transferred to the Toronto District Catholic School Board and renamed Bishop Allan Academy. The design challenge was to transform the facility into a composite academic high school for 950-1200 students. The project entailed a complex phased renovation/addition program in a user-occupied facility. The original project was completed in 1993.
Since then, continuing demand for the popular school has necessitated further expansion of the classroom and infrastructure capacity as well as numerous specialty classroom renovations. This has included filling in the under-utilized interior courtyard to double the cafeteria size and add mezzanine level classrooms, as well updated science labs and art room facilities. The architect was Scott Shields Architect and Newgen Construction Corporation completed the work in September 2006.",Postmodern,Stonegate-Queensway (16)

The original village was north of Queen Street West; east of Roncesvalles from Fermanagh Avenue, east to the main rail lines. It was roughly one square kilometre in area.

1889 Apr 18: Name of Lansdowne School changed to Parkdale School. (Toronto already had a Lansdowne School, opened in 1888; it was renamed Lord Lansdowne in 1967.)
1909-10: Old building replaced by a three-storey school of 15 rooms designed by Charles H. Bishop. 
1914: Addition.
1922: Addition. School had 18 rooms, including a Home Economics room, an Industrial Arts room and kindergartens. Approximately 630 pupils; average class size was 35.

architectural styles of the late 19th century (including Gothic Revival, Italianate and Queen
Anne) in a design that is best described as Picturesque. The 2Â½-storey structure is built of red
brick and trimmed with brick, stone and terra cotta. The hipped-gable roof has a trio of gables
with decorative wood detailing on the south end. On the south faÃ§ade, the three-bay composition
features a recessed centre with the entrances in the first storey and round-headed window
openings in the second floor and attic. In the outer bays, bay windows rise three stories and
contain segmental-headed openings in the lower floors and flat-headed openings in the attic. The
entries and most of the fenestration is decorated with brick voussoirs and stone drip moulds with
keystones. Running stone lintels and sills create horizontal divisions. Terra cotta panels with
scrollwork and animal heads are placed above the bay windows, and a similar motif is found in a

In 1885, the Consumers Gas Company acquired the land west of Trinity Street and south of Front Street to the railway tracks. The building that presently houses the Imperial Oil Opera Theatre (originally 251 Front St. E.) was built as the Consumers Gas CompanyÂ´s Purifying House No. 2 in 1887-1888 by the architects Strictland and Symens, who designed it in the style of an early Christian basilica. (It has been suggested that the special clerestory roof was built as a self-supporting structure and simply placed on top of the building so that any explosion would raise it without destroying the walls.) It was renovated in the mid 1980Â´s for the Canadian Opera Company.This propertyâs contribution lies in its historic role in the

The Palace Tavern used to operate out of the building. In 1897, attached brick houses were built along Strachan Avenue (95-99 Strachan Avenue). In 1902, attached houses were also added along King Street (938-944 King Street West). 

In the 1970s, the building was converted to a low-cost, long-term hotel for men by a new owner.
 
In 2014, it was put up for sale. It was purchased by Intentional Capital in 2017, with the intention of residential redevelopment. At the time of its sale, it was still used as a rooming house for men with over 90 rooms; tenants at the time were offered compensation to leave, although about 14 tenants remain. In May 2018, a Planning Application was submitted to the City of Toronto proposing to redevelop it into a 16-storey mixed-use residential property. The proposal includes ground floor retail space, a floor of rental studio apartments, and condos.",Romanesque revival,Niagara (82)

Competition
In 1905, the City of Toronto opened a competition for Canadian Architects to submit designs for the new library. It was to be built as part of a $350 000 grant from Andrew Carnegie for four new libraries in Toronto, along with Yorkville (1907), Queen and Lisgar (1909), and Riverdale (1910). This was the largest of Toronto’s Carnegie libraries.
The winning architect would be given the commission for the building, and the customary 5% commission rate on the cost of the building. The cost allotted for the building was $260 000, and the competition programme made several specifications for the building, such as being built of fire-proof material, high ceilings, and large windows. It also stated that is should be designed with future additions in mind.
Winning Design 
19 plans were submitted to the competition, and Wickson & Gregg and A.H. Chapman’s design was selected as winner in 1906. Their design was a Neo-classical building; the symmetrical façade had entrances on each end of the College St. side of the building. Classical elements in the interior include columns, rounded arches, and ornate ceilings.
The cornerstone to the building was laid on November 27, 1906 and it opened to the public in September 1909.
Addition
In 1928-30, an addition by Chapman & Oxley (in association with Wickson & Gregg) was constructed.
Heritage Desingation

detailing, the Commodore Building is architecturally significant as a good example of the
substantial warehouses that appeared in the 1920s. Anchoring the southeast corner of Adelaide
Street West and Peter Street, the building is a landmark in the King-Spadina neighbourhood that
contributes contextually to the character of the area as it expanded after World War I. The heritage attributes of the building are found on the exterior walls and roof with attention
focused on the north and west facades. The ten-storey structure is built of concrete with buff
brick and stone cladding on the elevations facing Adelaide and Peter Streets. On the north
faÃ§ade with its stone-clad base, a central two-storey round-arched entrance has buttresses, reed
moulding, floral motifs, and a nameplate. The commercial windows in the first floor (some have
been altered) and the paired flat-headed window openings in the second level are separated by
buttresses beneath a frieze with Gothic-inspired ornament. The upper-storey window openings
are divided horizontally by recessed panels and vertically by piers and pilasters of varied widths.
Rib-like stone buttresses extend to the tenth floor to form crenellations along the flat roof. A
tower centered above the facade features similar Gothic decoration. The pattern of fenestration
and the decoration is repeated on the west wall, while the visible portion of the east elevation has
large commercial windows.",Commercial style,Waterfront Communities-The Island (77)

Prior to this date the original structure was a two-storey wood frame building. Its exterior is in excellent condition and its Edwardian style is the only edifice left of its kind between Trinity and Sackville Streets. Located on the eastside of Gilead Place, #18 Eastern Avenue, is a heritage bookend structure to âlistedâ row houses located at the north end of Gilead Place, numbers 457-461 King Street East (part of Wilkins Row). 

The history of Eastern Avenue, especially that of the area east of Trinity Street, is associated with the Macedonians, and people of Balkan origin, whose history in Corktown during the early 1900s is documented.  By 1905, approximately 500 Macedonians, Bulgarians and other people of Balkan origin were living in Corktown, and by 1910, the number of such settlers to Toronto had doubled. Many of these people worked in nearby factories while others operated businesses throughout the neighbourhood including mom-and-pop storefronts along Eastern Avenue.  Deeply committed to their religion and culture, Corktownâs Macedonian community raised money to establish a church at Trinity and Eastern Avenue in 1910. 

Mr. Haji D.Peroff, founding member and owner of 18 Eastern Avenue, played a key role in the purchase of the church property. Hence, to demolish #18 Eastern Avenue, at the north-east corner Eastern Avenue and Gilead Place (former â H.D. Peroff â grocery store), will erase a significant part of Corktownâs built and cultural history.

1915: School formally opens on August 31. This original building was designed by Ross & Macfarlane.
1930-31: Addition built.
1951: South addition with aircraft and auto mechanic facilities, a new auditorium, and a cafeteria. The old auditorium was converted into a gymnasium.
1932: Due to increasing number of aircraft students, a garage (""the Annex"") at 844 Bathurst Street is purchased.
1962: Arts Centre built on the north side of the main building.
1967: The ""Bathurst Building"" constructed, consisted of shop rooms, two gymnasia, and a pool.
1985: Arts Center addition in the brutalist style designed by Macy Dubois.

Contextually, the building is a local landmark as one of the few institutional buildings found in the King-Spadina neighbourhood. 

The heritage attributes of the building are found on the exterior walls and roof. Rising three stories above a basement, the structure is built of reinforced concrete blocks clad with brown brick and trimmed with stone. On the six-bay principal (east) facade, the main entrance is located at street level in the right (north) bay. A round-arched stone portal with a multi-paned transom is decorated with an oversized hood mould, carved spandrels, a name plaque, and a date stone. Narrow rectangular openings are paired in the basement level beneath a thick stone band course. 

The horizontal emphasis is continued in the first floor where a continuous stone sill connects the large flat-headed window openings.

The program called for the traditional planning to be re-interpreted with the church group to develop a modern interpretation of the traditional planning and finishes of a church into a new modern and inclusive setting in a much smaller space. The planning is centred on promoting inclusiveness and social interaction from the entry signage to the actual physical space to the modern audio video features for online services and outreach to those that cannot attend for various reasons.

In 1967 Chaminade, along with 13 other Catholic high schools, entered into a partnership with the Board. The Board operated the first two years of secondary school and the Archdiocese ran the remainder. From September 1972 to June 1988 the school was administered by the Irish Christian Brothers.

In a note to ACO President, architect Annabel Vaughan noted ""This is a beautiful little gem of a pavilion....would be a shame to bastardize it."" ACO President Catherine Nasmith wrote to the Councillor´s office to express concern about the facing of the columns in stone, the loss of the stone washroom facilities. Executive Assistant Mary Campbell responded that the concerns had been shared with Parks staff, and that ""staff will implement as they deem appropriate.""
