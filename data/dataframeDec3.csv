Allen, Auxiliary Bishop for the Archdiocese of Toronto from 1954 until his death in 1972. Bishop Allen was a man known for his firm commitment and support of Catholic education. Our community strives to express his vision of Catholic education, one that is rich in intellectual tradition and is relevant and powerful in its social message. Bishop Allen Academy is situated on 14½ acres on a beautiful ravine that runs parallel to the Mimico Creek. This property was part of the original piece of land surveyed in the township of Etobicoke in 1793 which was set aside for the use of the government mill or the King's Mill which was located at the first rapids upstream from Lake Ontario. In 1961 the Etobicoke Board of Education decided on this site for the building of a high school, Kingsmill Vocational School, which housed 500 student.In 1989 it was transferred to the Toronto District Catholic School Board and renamed Bishop Allan Academy. The design challenge was to transform the facility into a composite academic high school for 950-1200 students. The project entailed a complex phased renovation/addition program in a user-occupied facility. The original project was completed in 1993.
Since then, continuing demand for the popular school has necessitated further expansion of the classroom and infrastructure capacity as well as numerous specialty classroom renovations. This has included filling in the under-utilized interior courtyard to double the cafeteria size and add mezzanine level classrooms, as well updated science labs and art room facilities.

The original village was north of Queen Street West; east of Roncesvalles from Fermanagh Avenue, east to the main rail lines. It was roughly one square kilometre in area.

1872: A group of parents established the first local school in a rented one-room cottage on Queen Street West and Brock Avenue, in Parkdale.
1877: Trustees of School Section No. 22, York Township, opened a school (with 12 pupils) in a small, rough-cast house on the site of the present school.
1878: A just-formed school board demanded a new school house for Brockton-Parkdale. When the town council refused, Chairman John Clark and Secretary-Treasurer Major John Gray erected the first school on Jameson Avenue at their own expense. 
1879: Parkdale incorporated as a village; school board had six members. Small cottage replaced by a two-roomed brick building. School named Jameson Avenue School. Principal: J.A. Wismer.
1881: Jameson Avenue north of Queen Street renamed Lansdowne Avenue for the then Governor General of Canada. (Presumably the school name changed to Lansdowne about this time.)
1884: Three-storey Victorian structure built as a model school.
1889 Mar 23: Parkdale annexed to city of Toronto; school became part of the city school system. It accommodated 650 pupils in 14 rooms; averaged 50 students per classroom.
1889 Apr 18: Name of Lansdowne School changed to Parkdale School. (Toronto already had a Lansdowne School, opened in 1888; it was renamed Lord Lansdowne in 1967.)
1909-10: Old building replaced by a three-storey school of 15 rooms designed by Charles H. Bishop. 
1914: Addition.
1922: Addition. School had 18 rooms, including a Home Economics room, an Industrial Arts room and kindergartens. Approximately 630 pupils; average class size was 35.
1958 Nov 6: New senior wing (begun in 1955) formally opened. School could now accommodate 800 students; grade 7 and 8 students came from Queen Victoria Public School.
1993 May: Students and staff moved to temporary site on playing field of Parkdale Collegiate Institute.
1995 Apr: New building occupied. The entrance to the old school has been kept as a separate structure. It can be seen at 75 Lansdowne Avenue, at the entrance to Parkdale Community Recreation Centre and Pool.",Postmodern,,1995.0,1990.0,Building,0.0

This original school was replaced in 1870 by a one room schoolhouse, known as School Section No. 20, on the site of the present-day school. This one-room schoolhouse was in use until 1895. After a new school opened in 1896, the one-room schoolhouse was used for public meetings. In 1904 it was sold to St. Johnâs Norway Church and transported down Kingston Road to be converted into a rectory. 

A Trustees Meeting in 1896 established that a new, two-story school building was needed. A competition was opened for plans for a new building; J.W. Malloryâs design was selected and built at a cost of $4000. When the 1896 school building opened, there were approximately 100 students.

July 1903: Increased enrollment required two rooms to be added to the north side of the building. By 1906, enrollment was at 243 students and the school was once again overcrowded. 

1910: 8 rooms added, becoming the east and west wings. Contractors for this addition substituted subpar building materials (for example, spruce and hemlock in place of pine and oak) to save money, something they did for several other schools. 

1913: Kindergarten began at Norway Public School.

1919: Building had 14 rooms and a portable, with an enrollment of 711 students. 

1920: 881 students. âNorway Annexâ addition added to the west of main building at a cost of $120 000. This included 6 new classrooms, subject-specific rooms, and kindergarten rooms. Later additions in 1922 and 1929 added more rooms. A proposed addition of pool, locker room, and shower room was abandoned due to budget constraints.
 
1931: Building contained 26 rooms and portables to accommodate 1142 students. 

1942: A fire destroyed the second floor of the main (1896) building. This floor was not rebuilt. 

In the 1970s, parents, teachers, and trustees lobbied the Board of Education to replace the old school buildings rather than eliminate the school. The new, current school building was officially opened on April 15, 1977.",Postmodern,,1976.0,1970.0,Building,0.0

Duncan Coulson, president of the Bank of Toronto occupied the house from 1889 to 1916 with his wife Eliza and three children. The Coulsons remodeled the dining room in an Art Nouveau style. Following Coulson's death, a three-storey school for the blind was built at the back of the house. This house was used as office space for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind from 1920 to 1956. A school for developmentally-challenged children later took its place until it was demolished in 1984. The replacement school now wraps respectfully around the restored George Brown House property.

In 1885, the Consumers Gas Company acquired the land west of Trinity Street and south of Front Street to the railway tracks. The building that presently houses the Imperial Oil Opera Theatre (originally 251 Front St. E.) was built as the Consumers Gas CompanyÂ´s Purifying House No. 2 in 1887-1888 by the architects Strictland and Symens, who designed it in the style of an early Christian basilica. (It has been suggested that the special clerestory roof was built as a self-supporting structure and simply placed on top of the building so that any explosion would raise it without destroying the walls.) It was renovated in the mid 1980Â´s for the Canadian Opera Company.This propertyâs contribution lies in its historic role in the
industrialisation of the District in the late 19th century, its relation to
adjacent 19th century industrial structures and its contemporary

Gradually the local residential neighbourhood was displaced by industry and the dwindling congregation could not meet the costs of maintaining the building.

On the day the heir to the British throne arrived in town, a deliriously happy crowd of half a million people lined the route from the airport to downtown, hoping to catch a glimpse of 25-year-old Princess Elizabeth and her dashing husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. The front page of the Toronto Star of October 13, 1951, featured no fewer than eight stories about the royal visit, including one describing a woman whose arm was broken when she fell in the crowd, and yet insisted on staying to watch the princess pass while lying on a stretcher. Tucked away on that same page was a tiny story about the ailing King George VI, Elizabeth's father, who had recently undergone a ""serious lung operation."" Elizabeth and Philip attended the Maple Leafs' game against the Chicago Black Hawks at the Gardens the following afternoon. The princess was presented with flowers by a young girl, and later with the game puck by the team's owner, proud monarchist Conn Smythe. The royal couple sat in a special box constructed in Section 50, and left after the first period. ""The prince relaxed during the game, breaking into hearty laughter and slapping his thigh at hard body checks on the ice,"" the Globe and Mail wrote. ""The princess betrayed her emotions by a wide-eyed look and an automatic jump of the royal shoulders when a player was hit hard.""

Derwyn T. Owen, and the  congregation held their first service in the new basement on  Dec. 5. The construction and furnishing of the church was  completed in 1940 during the incumbency of the Rev. Wm. E. Kibblewhite.

Robert Baldwin first introduced the concept of Responsible Government in Parliament in 1848 which lead to the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. Today an historic plaque on the exterior next to the entrance of Starbucks commemorates this site.2) In 1824 William Lyon Mackenzie moved into the house here at Front and Frederick Streets and began publication of a newspaper, The Colonial Advocate. In one particular article published in June 1826, Mackenzie, hell-bent on attacking members of the upper-class, the so-called Family Compact, published their scandalous private comings and goings and the ensuing uprising it caused - the so-called Types Riot - is remembered today in a plaque on the Frederick Street side of the condo that now stands there. William Lyon Mackenzie was elected Toronto's first mayor when the Town of York was incorporated into a city and renamed Toronto in 1834.3) The next influential family to move here was the Cawthra family in 1828 who would later make their fortune in apothecary (pharmaceuticals). The Cawthras became the undisputed leaders of high society, marrying into other well-heeled families of 19th century Toronto. When William Cawthra died in 1880 and left no children to inherit the vast fortune, it was divided up among the many nieces and nephews.

A Methodist and strong promotor of Christian ways, Temperance Street was named by Mr. Ketchum. Leases to the lots on his land included a unique caveat that allows him to prohibit ""nauseous or offensive"" uses. This early land use control was used to limit hotels that used alcohol and to promote Christian institutions which were established on Temperance Street. In addition to his gift of land for Jesse Ketchum School and Jesse Ketchum Park in Yorkville, Mr. Ketchum donated the land for Knox Church, which once occupied a site to the north of this park. The Richmond Street Methodist Church occupied a site to the west of the park. The name and date stone that was above the front door of the Methodist church [Wesleyan A. D. 1844] has been placed in the park garden. In the 19th century the area developed with the mix of uses and buildings typical of early Toronto - institutional uses mixed with rowhouses, commercial chambers and small manufacturing. The 20th century saw the decline of residential uses in the area. After the building of City Hall at Queen and Bay, Bay Street became the financial and office centre for the region.

Follow the access road to the third parking lot. The plaque is along the west side of the lot. HistoryScouts camped in this valley, with permission of the owners, in the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1936, approximately 40 ha were purchased by the Toronto District of The Boy Scouts Association from the Lennox family who were farmers in the area. Only 24 km from Toronto and featuring hills, valleys, woods, a creek and abundant wildlife, it was an ideal spot for day hikes, short-term camps, camporees, training courses, group meetings, corn and wiener roasts and cuborees.The name ""Camp of the Crooked Creek"" was selected through a competition open to Toronto Scouting youth. In the early years there was no road into the valley and consequently everything - tents, equipment, food and packs - had to be carried down the hill and, at the end of the camp, carried back up again.In 1963, approximately 20 ha of the north end, bordering on Ellesmere Road, was sold for the construction of Scarborough Centenary Hospital. Scouting continued to use the remainder of the property until 1968 when it was taken over by The Metropolitan Toronto Conservation Authority.Over the thirty-two years that Camp of the Crooked Creek operated, it is estimated that camper days (one camper for one day) totalled about 750,000. Thousands of Cubs and Scouts lit their first camp fire, cooked their first camp meal, spent their first night under the stars and learned their first woodcraft skills.The camp was used year-round and many will remember their first experience of winter camping.Gilwell LodgeHalf hidden in the woods on the north side of a large, level, grassy area near the south end of the property was Gilwell Lodge, a 6 m by 12 m frame structure with a stone fireplace and a kitchen area with a wood burning cook stove. This area was used for leadership training. Hundred of adults attended training courses in this area where they learned Scouting programming and outdoor skills to pass on to their young members.During World War II, this area was used for ""Camp Victory"". This was a camp for Scouts whose leaders were serving in the armed forces and thus could not take part in their own troop camp.Campfire pavillionBuilt in the trees near the bottom of the hill, just south of what is now Campfire Pit 8, was a 15 m by 15 m wooden platform with built-in benches around the perimeter and a large stone pillar fireplace with a steel smoke canopy in the centre. Many happy campfires were held here with singing, skits and marshmallow toasting.ChapelJust below the top of the hill on the west side near what is now Plover Road, was a rustic outdoor chapel with a log altar and log seats. Each Sunday, ""Scouts Own"" was held, which was a non-denominational worship service, planned and conducted by Scouts. Occasionally, a camping troop would arrange for their own chaplain to come and conduct a service. The chapel was also used on occasion for investitures of new Cubs, Scouts, Rovers and/or leaders.Swimming HoleEach year, the creek was dammed to create a swimming hole. As anyone with knowledge of this valley will know, the creek bed is very unstable. The result was that often during a heavy rain storm, the dam washed out and it took several days to repair. However, thousands of Scouts recall happily splashing in the swimming hole.",,Parks and Recreation,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: The Parkdale Village Business Improvement Area (PVBIA) encompasses the area along Toronto's celebrated Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue. Because of its close proximity to the waterfront, Parkdale was once a resort spot for Torontonians - with beautiful summer homes nestled among lush trees and plants. As Toronto blossomed into Canada's greatest city, Parkdale grew alongside it - transforming from a quaint beach-side community to the vibrant and bustling urban area we know and love today. This development has had immeasurable benefits for Parkdale; although sadly the transformation cost us many of our beautiful trees. The PVBIA, working in conjunction with local businesses, community members and proudly supported by TD Green Streets, aims to reverse this damage by planting trees and greenery within our neighbourhood, such as in these urban garden plots located at the northern corners of Brock Avenue and Queen Street West.Originally, this land was covered in forests of sugar maples, beech, yellow birch, white ash and hemlock. The name Parkdale, fixed upon in the 1870s, was meant to convey images of decorative gardens and fertile country-side.In 1812, 97 ha of land surrounding Lot Street (now known as Queen) between Jameson and Dufferin Avenues were granted to James Brock for his military service. Upon Brock's death, his widow Lucy Brock commissioned a roadway along the centre-line of the length of the lot parcel. This road, built in 1850, is today known as Brock Avenue.In 1852, writer W.H. Smith described Brock Street as ""a cluster of houses, three of which are taverns"". Until the late 19th century, this street was the centre of Parkdale's social and commercial activity and was the main north-south route.",,Parks and Recreation,,,Plaque,0.0

The Dominion Day Regatta was held at the Hanlan's Point Lagoon course from 1894 until about 1915 when it was moved to Long Pond. The Island Amateur Aquatic Association also hosted many social and competitive events on the islands.Allan Lamport played a key role in enlarging the regatta course at Long Pond to international competition standards when, in 1937, he was appointed to a committee studying air transportation needs.

Erected by the East York Historical Society in 2006, it tells how the farm became integrated into our city over the years. Here's the plaque text: In 1897, Walter Massey, President of Massey-Harris Company, purchased about 100 ha of land to establish an experimental farm. Walter named the farm ""Dentonia Park"" after his wife, Susan Marie Denton. The farm produced eggs and poultry as well as trout. Dentonia was also the home of a prized dairy herd that sparked the formation of the City Dairy Company. The City Dairy produced the first pasteurized milk in Canada, which helped to combat tuberculosis and typhoid fever among Toronto children. In 1901, Walter Massey passed away after contracting typhoid fever, but Susan continued to operate Dentonia Park Farm well after his death. Walter's brother, Chester (and his children Vincent and Raymond) and Susan's children (Ruth, Madeline, Dorothy and Denton) also lived at Dentonia. The Goulding Estate was built in 1921 for Dorothy Massey Goulding. In the benevolent tradition of the Massey family, Susan donated 25 ha of Dentonia, in memory of her husband, to the City of Toronto around 1926, for use as a public park to be named ""Dentonia Park"". Susan generously donated her home (built in 1914) along with 16 ha of Dentonia, to Crescent School (an independent school for boys) in 1933. Until Susan's death in 1938, she continued to live at Dentonia with her daughter Madeline. Crescent School operated at Dentonia until 1969 when it moved and the property was developed into the Crescent Town neighbourhood. Prior to 1900, the neighbourhood south of the Massey Farm developed, a portion of which became part of East York Township in 1924. Many other residential and recreational areas were created out of the Dentonia Park Farm, including the City of Toronto's Dentonia Park Golf Course and part of Taylor Creek Park.

Identical displays exists at the eastern side of the bridge over Yonge Street as well as at the eastern end of the trail on Moore Avenue. Here's what it says: The Belt Line is the name given to a railway line that encircled Toronto and was completed in 1892. The Toronto Belt Line Railway Company proposed to generate and exploit a real estate boom in North Toronto by providing commuter rail and freight service from the new suburbs to the heart of the city. The line branched from the main line to Barrie and points north near Eglinton and Castlefield Avenues, headed east to Bathurst, then swung south east to Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road before turning south down the Moore Park Ravine and descending to the Don Valley and, eventually, Union Station. The railway was not successful. Toronto's real estate boom ended, and after only 28 months passenger service was suspended. The steeply graded section from the Don Valley to Mount Pleasant Road, being unsuitable for steam-powered freight traffic, was torn up during the Great War, and the rails were shipped to France. The remainder of the line remained in use until the early 1960's as a long industrial spur from Castlefield Avenue to Mount Pleasant Road, to serve local industrial uses along Merton Street. The roadbed east of Mount Pleasant has disappeared under Mount Pleasant Cemetery. In 1990, in recognition of its recreational potential, the City of Toronto purchased the Belt Line from CN Real Estate. Then City Councillor Kay Gardner was the driving force behind the City's acquisition of these Beltline lands and their conversion to a 4.5-kilometre long linear park. Since then the Parks and Recreation Division has enhanced it and nurtured the regeneration of its natural environment, while preserving a record of Toronto's late nineteenth century industrial and residential landscape. It is a place to smell flowers, watch birds, ride a bike - a place in the heart of the city to escape the city. Kay Gardner and her husband Raymond moved to North Toronto in 1961. Since then, she worked tirelessly, first as a citizen volunteer and then as a City Councillor, for her community, tenants, and particularly for senior citizens.

The plaque says: The vision of a grand lakefront amusement pier was conceived in the 1920s as a rival for the neighbouring Sunnyside Pavilion. The pier was designed by Craig  &  Madill with various structures in a flamboyant Moroccan style of architecture, and was to project 550 metres into Lake Ontario terminating with a steamboat landing. Financial difficulties in the early 1930s delayed the construction. Only the first phase of the redesigned amusement pier, 90 metres long, was opened on June 10, 1941 and it became popular as a major dance hall of the big band era during World War II and the postwar years. The pier was destroyed by fire in 1963, and the site later redeveloped into condominiums and public park.

For them, the stream would have been a sacred site - a place of powerful and audible spirits.Philosopher's Walk continues to be a special meeting place to this day. The amphitheatre you see here rests at the point where a number of paths intersect and is a natural gathering place for university students, school groups and pedestrians from all walks of life.

Dr. Norman Allen, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, wrote to the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1891, asking for help. The sisters sent six nuns to care for the ill at the Isolation Hospital. By 1894, the hospital had established a training school for nurses. In 1922, Riverdale Isolation Hospital became the University of Toronto's teaching centre for the treatment of communicable diseases. It was supervised by Dr. Beverly Hannah. A nurses' residence was soon built to support this important program. In 1945 the hospital's South Building was renovated and renamed the Hannah Building. Between 1910 and 1929, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Charles Hastings brought about many health reforms in Toronto. He helped reduce the spread of disease by creating policy for public vaccination. He spearheaded legislation to pasteurize milk and chlorinate drinking water.

Here's what it says: Now landlocked on Fleet Street, this lighthouse once stood on the Queen's Wharf. The wharf - originally known as New Pier - was built in 1833 to stimulate commercial activity in the west part of the harbour.This lighthouse, constructed in 1861 on the north side of the west extension, was the second built for the Queen's Wharf. Noted architect Kivas Tully, later architect of the Ontario Department of Public Works, designed its octagonal plan for what became, in 1911, the Toronto Harbour Commission. The Queen's Wharf Lighthouse, along with a lighthouse farther west on the pier, guided ships safely into the western harbour.Beginning in the 1880s, the area west of Queen's Wharf was filled in with lake dredging. The old channel into the harbour could not be maintained and, in 1911, the lighthouse was decommissioned.

3840,7946,A Brief History,,,,43.659159,-79.403537,http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Brief_History.html,,,,Plaque,http://torontoplaques.com,"This plaque, a brief history of Kensington Hospice, can be found in front of 38 Major Street, north of College Street. Here's what it says: For well over a hundred years this building has been associated with delivering health care services to the community.It was originally built in 1892 as a convent and chapel by the Anglican sisters of St. John the Divine who in 1889, had opened the ""St. John's Surgical Hospital for Women"" next door to it. Under their auspices, that hospital became a general hospital in the 1920's and, after 1937, it provided accommodation, shelter, and respite care until it and the chapel were sold in 1951. The interior ceiling of the chapel was later declared to be of historical significance and has been preserved to this day.In the 1950's, four brothers who had committed themselves to practicing in the community where they grew up, acquired this building from the sisters along with the adjacent buildings and properties and constructed a modern, full scale, 319-bed acute care hospital, the ""Doctors Hospital"".The Raxien brothers -- Dr. Sam Raxien (dentist), Dr. Alex Raxien (surgeon), Dr. Ben Raxien (anesthesiologist) and Dr. Saul Raxien (family practitioner) -- also constructed an office building for doctors, dentists and other professionals at 25 Brunswick Avenue. Many of the tenants there joined the staff of Doctors Hospital or supplied services to its patients.This building was connected by a corridor to the first floor of the Doctors Hospital and the chapel area served as an auditorium for medical and nursing staff meetings, medical lectures and presentations, intern and other training seminars, and general meetings involving health care and community issues.The community, which then stretched from Bloor Street to the north and the Kensington Market area to the south, was one of the main areas where newcomers to Canada and Toronto first settled. Predominantly a working and middle class neighbourhood, it hosted wave after wave of immigrants from England, Ireland, Middle and Eastern Europe, Russia, Italy, Portugal, China, Vietnam and other eastern and Asian countries, to name but a few. Consequently, this area was always alive and bustling with the sounds and sights of different languages and customs.At the heart of the philosophy of the four founders of the Doctors Hospital was a commitment to accommodate as many of the cultures in the community as possible and to provide a multi-faith and ethnic-appropriate approach to patient care, while being an innovative, leading edge provider of modern health care services on a not-for-profit basis.Unlike other public hospitals at the time, no restrictions were placed on visiting times, recognizing that many in the community worked outside normal working hours; overnight visits were permitted to comfort patients unaccustomed to hospital stays; ethnic food was provided or could be brought in by family members; doctors and staff could converse with patients in their own languages and translators were on staff for cases where they could not. The Doctors Hospital rightfully boasted that it was the hospital ""where more than 40 languages are spoken"".In 1969, the remaining Raxlen brothers retired and the Doctors Hospital became a publicly owned hospital. It continued to carry on and expand its services in the tradition of its founders, but when the Ontario government decided to reduce the number of active care hospitals in the province, it was forced to close its doors in 1998.Subsequently, Doctors Hospital changed its name to ""The Kensington Health Centre"" and commenced a new era in the delivery of not-for-profit health care.The Kensington Health Centre, with the assistance of the Kensington Foundation, carried out the demolition of the hospital tower and the office building on Brunswick Avenue. In their place, two modern long term care facilities were built as well as various state-of-the-art ambulatory patient services in the College Street clinical building, including the Kensington Eye Institute and the Kensington Cancer Screening Centre.This building was eventually renovated with the help of private donations to house a palliative care residential hospice that opened in August, 2011.All are accessible to the community and the province at large.Inspired by the commitment of the Raxien brothers and in particular, the vision and ambition of Dr. Sam Raxien, the first President and CEO of Doctors Hospital, as well as the innovative and forward thinking of Brian McFarlane, the first president and CEO of the Kensington Health Centre, this hospice will continue the philosophy of health care that they fostered.By providing compassionate, supportive, non-denominational, and responsive end of life care for residents, family members and friends who come here from all backgrounds, cultures, religions and means, the legacy of all who have contributed to this history will be ensured.",,Medical Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

The ""Clarkewood Residence"" moved to Bayview Avenue when the CNIB consolidated its operations there in 1956. The property was then purchased by doctors Paul and John Rekai, who had immigrated to Toronto from Hungary in 1950. In May 1957 they opened a 32 bed private hospital with a multilingual staff committed to providing health care to people of diverse cultural backgrounds.

A College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario plaque attached to the gates here at 80 College Street tells the story of their journeys: These wrought iron lock-up gates were purchased by the College in 1888 for the main entrance to its newly constructed offices at 371 Bay Street, located on the south east corner of Bay and Richmond Streets in Toronto. They are the only remaining artifacts from the building which served as the College's home until 1905. The manufacturer was J.H. Pendrick who was contracted for a sum of $420 (whether this included other work is not known). The gates would have folded open to the side during the day and closed at night to discourage loitering or sleeping in the entranceway. When the building was demolished in 1960, Mr Warwick Noble, College solicitor and son of the former Registrar, Dr Robert T. Noble, rescued the gates and brought them to his country home near Norval, Ontario. The following year he suggested that they be used in the construction of the College's new building at 64 Prince Arthur. The Registrar, Dr Dawson, agreed, and had two sections lengthened in order to be mounted at the entrance to the parking lot. When the College moved to its present location in 1983, the gates were purchased by Stan Burr, a College staff member, who kept them for many years at his property in Durham. Mr Burr believed the gates should once again belong to the College and so returned them on his retirement in 1999.",,Medical Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

It was beside the Don River, which was considered an excellent setting to promote moral and physical health.The city built the House of Refuge in 1860 to care for the ""poor, needy, and disabled."" Then in 1872, an outbreak of smallpox meant that patients had to be treated in isolation. The House of Refuge shifted its focus to caring for them. By 1891 the facility was also caring for people with other contagious diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and scarlet fever. It became known as the Isolation Hospital. A brand new facility was built in 1893, and by 1904 it was known as Riverdale Isolation Hospital.Over the next 50 years the facility kept changing to meet the needs of the community. It created a training school for nurses in 1894. New buildings with more beds were built in 1911. A measles ward was built in 1927.Renamed Riverdale Hospital in 1957, the care mandate was expanded to include chronic illnesses and rehabilitation services. It specialized in orthopedics, surgery, oncology, neurotrauma, amputees, post-cardiac patients, and palliative care.Today, Bridgepoint Active Healthcare is a global leader in research and treatment of complex health conditions and rehabilitation.

The hospital's mandate was expanded to include chronic illnesses and rehabilitative services, with specializations in orthopedics, surgery, oncology, neurotrauma, amputees, post-cardiac patients, and palliative care.In 1959 the architecture firm of Chapman and Hurst was awarded a commission to design an exciting new Riverdale Hospital building. Their design offered patients attractive views of Riverdale Park. The choice of the interior brick and woodwork finishings provided a warm and comforting effect.The design also used bright colours and playful forms. For example, there was a large mosaic mural in the hospital lobby. Mushroom-shaped canopies marked its entrance. The canopies have been preserved as an example of the former architecture. The mosaic mural, call Life, has been restored. It is now on the main floor of the new hospital.",,Medical Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

When he spoke at Maple Leaf Gardens on March 3, 1932, the great statesman had entered the Wilderness Years, a time when it seemed his political career was finished, before being revived so magnificently during the Second World War. And so he hit the road, just as he had as a famous young globetrotting soldier and war correspondent back in 1900, embarking on a public speaking tour of North America because he needed the money. Still, Churchill cut quite a figure, greeting reporters in the sitting room of his suite at the Royal York Hotel before the speech. ""Mr. Churchill's face is round and pink. His hands are square and pink. His hair, what remains of it, is gold - an astonishingly bright gold. His cigar is long and black,"" wrote the reporter from the Globe and Mail. Newspaper advertisements that day trumpeted: ""An unprecedented event - and unequaled opportunity to hear one of Britain's great men!"" Good seats were available for between fifty cents and a dollar. But even with the added attraction of the 48th Highlanders band, the turnout had to be a bit disappointing - just 6,000, less than half of the arena's capacity, and they had to strain to make out Churchill's words through a crackling public address system. ""His 'Can you hear me?' made one feel that he was putting through a long distance telephone call. The response made one think he had got a wrong number,"" wrote John Herries McCulloch in the Toronto Star. Despite those challenges, Churchill managed to get his message across loud and clear: a strong and united British Empire was the best protection against another Great War. ""Mark you, England's weakness is the world's danger, and the strength of the Empire guarantees world peace,"" he said. Churchill closed his speech with a flourish, playing to the many loyalists in the crowd. ""The Mother country has revived!,"" he said. ""She is gathering her children around her, and, hand in hand with Canada, will lead the Empire and the world out of the gloom of panic and depression back into the sunlight of prosperity.""-Stephen Brunt",,Public Service,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: Two of the greatest and most flamboyant political careers in Canada's history reached watershed moments at Maple Leaf Gardens, one drawing to a humiliating close, the other seeming to gain new life. On September 9, 1967, the Progressive Conservative Party held its leadership convention at the Gardens. John Diefenbaker had been the party's face since 1956, and for six years the Prime Minister of Canada. But after losing consecutive elections, the rank and file wanted him out. The Chief kept his intentions secret until the last minute, when he filed nomination papers, and joined a crowded field vying for the job. But on the first ballot, he finished fifth, and on the second, many of his supporters deserted him for other candidates. Understanding that his position was hopeless, Diefenbaker voted once more then left abruptly, heading back to his hotel with no intention of returning to the Gardens. In the end, he thought better of it, and came back at the end of the night to rally support behind his successor, Robert Stanfield. ""Don't, as the fire of controversy burns around your leader, add gasoline to that fire,"" he told the crowd. Twelve years later, the largest political rally in Canadian history packed 18,000 people into the arena, an echo of the Trudeaumania phenomenon eleven years before. But on May 9, 1979, Pierre Trudeau - the man Stanfield could never beat - was fighting for his political life, blamed by Canadians for a failing economy. Following performances by Sylvia Tyson, the Good Brothers, and the Downchild Blues Band, Trudeau took the stage like a rock star, and made a passionate argument for the patriation of Canada's constitution. ""What began as an embarrassment is a shame,"" he said. This time the voters weren't buying, though. Thirteen days later, they elected Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives with a minority government. Trudeau resigned, only to stay on when Clark's government fell unexpectedly after only nine months. The Liberals won a majority in 1980. And in 1982, the Constitution came home.-Stephen Brunt",,Public Service,,,Plaque,0.0

As a result of the United States government passing the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, thousands of African Americans fled to Canada. This law allowed slave owners to arrest both runaway Blacks and even free African Americans anywhere in the country with little legal recourse for the accused. In response, Brown became a major force in founding the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada. The Society fought to end slavery in North America while individual members helped freedom-seekers reach Canada via the Underground Railway. As a consequence, the African Canadian community enthusiastically supported his electoral ambitions. Brown was encouraged in his abolitionist politics by his father, Peter Brown.

Walter Stewart Branch of the Toronto Public Library, is this plaque erected by the East York Historical Society with assistance from the East York Foundation, CFUW Leaside - East York and the City of Toronto. Here's what it says: Jean Gertrude Davidson, known throughout her life as True, moved to East York in 1947, where she became actively involved in her new community. Her energetic and enthusiastic support for enriched educational programming led to her election to the East York Board of Education in 1948, followed, in 1952, by her election as its first female Chair. In 1958 she joined the East York Township Council and was elected its first female Reeve in 1960. In 1967 she led a spirited and successful defense against amalgamation into Toronto. East York was instead merged with Leaside to form the new Borough of East York and elected her as its first Mayor. Her term in office was marked by the belief that a community's quality of life was created by the activities of its citizens, rather then buildings and public works alone. Her philosophy was shown in her ability to inspire and attract intelligent and dedicated people to serve their community, both on municipal boards and committees. A firm believer in the promotion and preservation of community culture and heritage, she founded and served as first Director of the East York Foundation and through that body created the Todmorden Mills museum as a community sponsored Centennial project in 1967. In 1969, during her final term on Council, she was elected by her peers as President of the Association of Mayors and Reeves of Ontario. True was a founding member of the Canadian Federation of University Women; she received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto and York University; was awarded the Order of Canada and the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal.

In 1794, shortly after the founding of the fort and the Town of York, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe ordered this burying ground laid out in a clearing a short distance from the fort. Simcoe's own infant daughter Katherine was the first to be buried here. At least 400 others - many of them soldiers with their wives and children - were laid to rest in the cemetery before it was closed in 1863.By then much had changed. In 1837, a plan of subdivision extended the city's street grid westward into the area. The cemetery, oriented by compass to magnetic north (unlike the roads), was enclosed within a new 2.4 ha public square named after Princess Victoria. Victoria Square was mirrored by Clarence Square to the east, and linked to it by an exceptionally wide boulevard called ""Wellington Place."" Intended to create a prestigious neighbourhood, the subdivision plan called for churches to be built in Victoria Square. However, only the Anglican Church of St. John the Evangelist was ever constructed.From Burying Ground to Public Park As the neighbourhood around Victoria Square filled in, .8 of the square's original 2.4 ha were lost to private development or used for the extension of Wellington Street. The cemetery itself suffered vandalism and use as a cattle pasture until the 1880s, when the City moved to protect it by converting it into a public park. The surviving grave markers were removed to the park's western edge, the uneven grave sites levelled, and walks laid out. In 1899, a marble tablet explaining the significant of this place was erected by the Canadian Club of Toronto as part of the city's first series of historical markers. The remarkable monument in the centre of the park was completed in 1907.By the mid-20th century, the area surrounding the park was dominated by industry, and Victoria Square's history was largely forgotten.

As such, it provides high-quality habitat for many wild creatures and functions as a migration corridor for wildlife within an intensely urbanized region. The park has been recognized for its ecological significance and is now part of the City's natural heritage system. To protect and enhance the ecological integrity of Morningside Park, the City of Toronto has undertaken native tree and shrub plantings at this site. As it runs through Morningside Park, Highland Creek is surrounded by steep valley slopes up to 30 metres high. In some areas, these slopes are unstable and are susceptible to erosion due to the composition of the soil. Shortly after World War II, the valley surrounding Highland Creek was inhabited by people affected by a housing shortage. These residents were regularly under threat from flash floods and erosion near their dwellings. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel hit Toronto and caused severe city-wide flooding. This event led to floodplain land in the Toronto region being acquired by public agencies and the Highland Creek valley has not been inhabited since then.",,Parks and Recreation,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what the French Toronto plaque has to say: Between the 1660s and 1759, the Humber River gained importance in the struggle between France and Britain for control of the fur trade with Aboriginal peoples.  That struggle led the French to establish a presence in what is today Toronto.In the 1670s, French trading posts opened at Kingston and Niagara to intercept Aboriginal traders paddling fur-laden canoes along the shores of Lake Ontario, en route to British outposts to the south. In 1720, a less significant post or magasin royal was built by the Sieur Douville near the former site of Teiaiagon, just up the river from here, to further attract Aboriginal fur traders coming down le passage de Toronto along the Humber. The post was staffed by a clerk and perhaps two soldiers, and lasted fewer than ten years due to British competition.In 1750, the French returned to the south end ofle passage de Toronto, and a new trading post, Fort Toronto, was built by the Sieur de Portneuf near here, closer to the mouth of the river. Within a year, that building was replaced by the more substantial Fort Rouillé (also known as Fort Toronto) on the site of today's Exhibition Place. It was burned and abandoned in 1759 after the British took control of Lake Ontario. The fort's remains were still visible to the first settlers in the Town of York (now Toronto) in 1793.

Artifacts from a 16th-century First Nations community, as well as substantial findings from a 19th-century village known as Milton Mills, were found buried here near the banks of the river.Milton Mills developed from a five-storey gristmill of the same name at the heart of this small community that relied on the wheat and flour industry for its existence. The mill was built by William Gamble who had, in the 1830s, purchased nearby King's Mill (built 1793). Roads and bridges, also constructed for Gamble, connected Milton Mills with surrounding farms and villages.At its peak in the 1840s, Milton Mills was home to approximately 100 people. Many were Irish and English immigrants seeking work from the mill. Archaeological evidence shows that the mill supported local tradesmen, including coopers and blacksmiths. Archaeologists also found remnants of workers' cottages and of a tavern and inn for farmers travelling to sell their grain.Repeal of the British Corn Laws in 1846 fundamentally altered Upper Canada's wheat and flour industry. Later, the development of railway networks eroded local markets. Many small mills and their related businesses were forced to close, including Milton Mills in 1865.The remains of Milton Mills were part of 485 hectares of land purchased by Robert Home Smith in the early 20th century.

In 1770, 11 years after the last French trading post in this area was abandoned, Rousseaux's father began to trade with the Mississaugas at the mouth of the Humber. Perhaps reusing the site of the French fort built by Portneuf, Jean-Baptiste Rousseaux carried on trade here until 1795 - long enough to help the British establish the roots of the modern City of Toronto. Other francophones then arrived to shape the new settlement, including the prominent merchant Laurent Quetton St George. The exact location of the Rousseaux home and store has not been discovered. In Rousseaux's day and well into the 20th century, the east bank here sloped gently to the river's edge, allowing for travellers to disembark from their boats, engage in trade, and begin the ancient Portage de Toronto or Carrying Place portage along the ridge now occupied by Riverside Drive.

Jacob and Elizabeth Cummer (Kummer) and their family were some of the earliest to settle in the area along with the Johnston, Willson and McBride families. The early community was often referred to as Kummer's Settlement. The Cummers are credited with having donated land on which a Methodist log chapel was built in 1834 at the north east corner of to-day's Yonge and Church Avenue. Adjacent to the church, the Johnston family offered part of their land to serve as a family burial ground. In 1856 the log church was replaced with a brick structure which boasted a towering, artistic spire that could be seen for miles around until a severe storm tore it down. Part of the original church site still remains as this pioneer cemetery built in memory of the early settlers who helped to establish the Willowdale Methodist Church. Willowdale boasted one of the earliest schools located at present-day Yonge Street and Ellerslie Avenue. The Willowdale School, SS #4 also known as Brown's School was originally built in 1842 with bricks made on the neighbouring farm of David Gibson. David Gibson, a land surveyor, farmer and politician is best remembered for his actions in the ill-fated Rebellion of 1837. As a result of his participation in the rebellion, Gibson's first home, which he and his wife, Eliza, built in 1829, was torched by government troops. With a price on his head for high treason, Gibson fled to the U.S. He and his family returned to Willowdale and, in 1851 built a new home on the same site. The Gibson House still stands today as a historic museum on Yonge Street north of City Hall.

British immigrants and second generation working class families from Toronto settled nearby and held well-paying jobs. The railway's regional repair yards were originally located south of St. Clair along West Toronto Street, later moving west to Runnymede Road where a small remnant is still in operation. These yards serviced 100 trains a day during the first half of the 20th century. Rail connected international markets which attracted businesses and sparked a period of land speculation.

Here's what they say: Village of YorkvilleOnce crossed by an ancient aboriginal trail (Davenport Road), the area known today as Yorkville was first permanently settled by those of European descent in the early 1800s. The Red Lion Inn, one of the first buildings in the area, was a stagecoach stop and vital gathering place. Economic growth was spurred by brick-making and brewing industries established from the 1830s.The community was linked in 1849 to the City of Toronto by H.B. Williams' horse-drawn omnibus service. In 1853 it was incorporation as the Village of Yorkville. Despite annexation by the City of Toronto in 1883, Yorkville remained a quiet community of predominantly middle- and working-class people well into the 20th century.In the 1950s, artists and actors transformed the area into a thriving arts community. By the mid- to late 1960s, Yorkville had become famous for its ""hippies,"" folk music, and coffee houses. Redevelopment has since altered much of the old incorporated Village. Still, streets north of Yorkville Avenue, west of Avenue Road (now part of the Annex), and east of Yonge Street (now part of South Rosedale) retain much of their 19th- and early 20th-century character.
	
	
Yorkville Town HallDesigned by William Hay, one of Toronto's most important early architects, the Yorkville Town Hall was built by William McGinnis, and opened on this site in 1860, fronting onto Yonge Street. High Victorian in style, it was constructed of local 'white' (yellow) bricks with red and blackened brick trim, and boasted three stained glass rose windows that illuminated a third-floor public hall seating 500.In its second-floor Council Chamber, local politicians debated, among other things, ""the running at large of Pigs and Swine and Poultry,"" the planking of sidewalks, and the ""prevention of immoderate driving."" In 1861, the privately owned horse-drawn Toronto Street Railway commenced service from the Town Hall to the St. Lawrence Market. After the clock tower was completed in 1889, the Town Hall's bells sounded the working day and rang for fire alarms.After annexation in 1883 ended Yorkville's village government, the Council Chamber was used as a public library. The building also housed the Yorkville Company of the York Rangers, the Naval Club, the offices of the Toronto Street Railway, and provided space for community use.The Yorkville Town Hall was destroyed by fire on November 12, 1941.

Though immigration to Canada directly from China was restricted after 1885, Ching was eventually joined by Chinese men who migrated from western Canada after helping to build the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Between 1900 and 1925, Toronto's first Chinese community took shape here, around Elizabeth Street which one ran all the way south to Queen Street. 'Chinatown' was a bustling commercial and residential area that included restaurants, grocery stores, and traditional clan associations. This first Chinatown thrived until the late 1940s, when the City of Toronto began its controversial expropriation of much of the neighbourhood to make room for a new city hall and the future Nathan Phillips Square. Demolition finally took place in 1955. Some Chinese businesses could not afford to re-locate, and closed.

Here's what it says: York Mills was established around mill sites on the west branch of the Don River. The community underwent several name changes which usually reflected the names of the most powerful mill owners. The first grist and saw mill was opened in 1804 by Samuel Heron on the east side of Yonge Street south of today's York Mills Road. In 1817, Millford Mills was opened farther north by Thomas Arnold. Seven years later, the Arnold mill property was bought by James Hogg, a prominent York Mills settler. Today, the area is still commonly referred to as Hogg's Hollow, the name of a subdivision plan developed by the Hogg family in 1856. An unsuccessful venture, the Hogg family sold only a few lots on what used to be John Street where only three worker's cottages were built. Today, two of these cottages have been incorporated into the Auberge du Pommier Restaurant. A little farther south, York Mills also claims the well-known Yonge Street landmark, the Jolly Miller Tavern. It too was built by the Hogg family in 1857 as the York Mills Hotel. During the Prohibition Years (1916-1927) the inn was a much frequented gambling spot to which the police made regular raids. It wasn't until the 1930s that the tavern was remodelled and renamed the Jolly Miller. For a short time, the Jolly Miller also housed one of Canada's most famous historical artists, C.W. Jefferys. His illustrations of early Canadian life are among the most treasured reminders of days gone by. At present, Old Yonge Street remains as the original Yonge Street path through the York Mills valley. Many historic structures still stand on Old Yonge Street, including St. John's Anglican Church.

An Indian trail connecting the Don and Humber Rivers wound its way along the foot of the hill. This shore line eventually became Davenport Road. These steep bluffs hampered the northward movement of early settlers. But as settlement progressed, much of the shorecliff was tamed and re-graded. A string of fine homes was built along its crest. In spite of these changes, the bluffs retained much of their imposing beauty. In 1913 a stairway was built on the Spadina Road alignment replacing an earlier wooden stairs. In recent times, this site was threatened by a proposal for a Spadina Expressway, with a tunnel beginning just below St. Clair Avenue, and exiting out of this hillside into a sweeping interchange.

Below those rapids, however, boating has been an important aspect of the Humber's history. For centuries, Aboriginal peoples approached the beginning of the Toronto Carrying Place near here in bark canoes - their remarkable craft that were quickly adopted by early Europeans. In the late 1670s, canoes were joined by French sailing ships that unloaded goods to be transported along the portage or, after 1720, to supply the French trading post at Toronto. In the 1790s, with British settlement and the establishment of water-powered mills, a growing number of vessels were moving supplies and produce up and down the river below the first rapids. Around 1800, a shipyard existed on this side of the Humber, just south of Bloor, that produced sailing ships - including one named Toronto. After the mid-19th century, commercial shipping was gradually replaced by recreational boating. Boathouses and marinas were built on the Humber's lower banks, and crowds would gather along the shore to watch boat races.

Here's what it says: Crawford Street passes through Trinity Bellwoods Park over a graceful triple-span concrete bridge which still exists, but is now buried beneath the street. The bridge once crossed a ravine carved by Garrison Creek as it flowed from north of St. Clair Avenue into Lake Ontario near Fort York. Crawford Street was first extended over the ravine on a wooden bridge in 1884. In 1914 and 1915, R.C. Harris, Commissioner of Works, had the old bridge replaced with one made of concrete. (A visionary, Harris was responsible for the Bloor Street Viaduct, 1918.) The bridge's spans, railings, and lampposts captured Harris's flair for dramatic public architecture. Both Garrison Creek and the Crawford Street Bridge now lie hidden beneath this park. By the 1880s, the creek was so polluted that it was gradually channelled underground into a brick sewer, built through here in 1885. Portions of the ravine were then filled in, here with earth from subway excavation in the 1960s. The bridge was buried up to its sidewalks and roadbed, and its railing and lampposts were removed. In 2004, the original sidewalks and roadbed were entirely rebuilt, but the remainder of the bridge rests intact beneath the surface.",,Transportation,,,Plaque,0.0

Eliminating the sale of alcohol was thought to raise the ""moral fibre"" of the community. Taverns, hotels and inns were denounced as ""cesspools of harlotry, vice and iniquity"". When DW Clendenan, a teetotaler and the town's mayor, ran for provincial office in 1890, his rival, David Gilmour, pointed out that he also owned the Swan Hotel. The ban was upheld despite referendums held in 1966, 1972, 1984 and 1988. After rail and factories left, neighbours in support and opposition of the ban both wanted to revitalize their community. Allowing the sale of alcohol would attract people to restaurants, bars and other places of social life.

All of the greats grappled here, from Jim Londos in the 1930's to Hulk Hogan in the 1980's. But two local wrasslin' icons stood above the rest - one a ""baby face"" and one a ""heel."" Whipper Billy Watson, real name William Potts, made his Gardens debut in 1940, shortly after he emigrated from England, and immediately became a crowd favourite. On March 15, 1956, he defeated Lou Thesz by count-out to win the World Heavyweight Championship, and fans and the local sports press celebrated the feat - as though it were absolutely 100% genuine. ""Isn't it wonderful! Isn't it great! Whipper Watson, world's heavyweight wrestling champion. Just imagine!"" Steve York wrote in the Globe and Mail, under a mammoth headline. Longtime Gardens promoter Frank Tunney, perhaps a little extravagantly, once estimated that Watson entertained five million people during his decades as a local headliner. On one famous night in 1959, Watson beat Gorgeous George, who was forced to shave his glorious golden locks as part of the bargain. And in 1965, the Whipper - who kept wrestling until being struck by a car and losing his left leg in 1971 - dispatched a nefarious newcomer called The Sheik. But that dastardly villain - whose real name was Eddie Farhat, and who hailed not from Syria, as billed, but from Detroit - would return, and in 1969 began the greatest ""winning"" streak in Toronto sports history. Week after week, he took on all comers at the Gardens - often with slippery manager Abdullah ""the Weasel"" Farouk in his corner. Employing all sorts of chicanery to which the oblivious referees somehow remained blind, he always managed to come out on top. The fans turned out in droves, hoping to see the bad guy finally get his comeuppance, including a record crowd of more than 18,000 on February 21, 1971, to see him defeat Tiger Jeet Singh. The Sheik's undefeated run finally came to an end after 15 years and 127 matches on August 11, 1974, when he made the mistake of attacking the referee, and lost by disqualification to Andre the Giant. -Stephen Brunt",,Sports,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what the plaques say: You are now standing on the abutment of a former Dundas Street bridge. Dundas Street crossed the Humber River here before it was rerouted in 1928 over the bridge immediately to the north.The government of Upper Canada (now Ontario) chose this natural point of crossing for Dundas Street, one of Ontario's earliest roads, and a vital link between the fledgling settlement of York (now Toronto) and settlements to the west. Dundas Street followed the easiest (not the straightest) route across the terrain, perhaps following an earlier Aboriginal trail.This point on the river was an excellent location for water-powered mills, the first of which was opened here by William Cooper in 1807. Much like a major manufacturing plant today, the mills became magnets for other tradesmen, including tanners, blacksmiths, and coopers, whose services were necessary for the functioning of the mill. These businesses formed the nucleus of an early hamlet called Cooper's Mills.In the 1840s, the Cooper mills were acquired by William P. Howland, and a larger, five-storey flour mill was constructed on the south side of the Dundas highway, just behind you. In 1851, Howland changed the name of the area to Lambton Mills to honour John George Lambton, a British reformer and former Governor General of Canada. By the mid-1850s, the village of Lambton Mills was a community of 500 - a milling centre, a travel stop on the Dundas highway, and a social centre for the local agricultural community.By the 1860s, logging and agriculture had altered drainage patterns in the Humber River watershed. The resulting fluctuations in water levels made water-powered mills increasingly unreliable. Howland's flour mill was fitted with a steam engine in the 1880s, but nevertheless closed after 1900.Lambton also lost its significance as a travel stop when modern expressways rendered the former Dundas highway into a local street. Today, only a few structures, including this bridge abutment and the 1847 Lambton House Hotel (at 4066 Old Dundas Street), remind us of the original Humber River community.",,Towns and Villages,,,Plaque,0.0

They were joined by the Hogg and Gray families who operated a gristmill (still standing on the Donalda Golf Club) and two sawmills on the West Don River nearby. By the 1850s, the crossroads of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue had a school and an inn. Further north stood a general store that also included the Don Post Office (est. 1868) and the local library (est. 1896). In the 1950s, this rural community was transformed into one of Canada's most significant post-war suburban developments.

From Farmland to ""New Town""In the midst of a housing shortage after World War II, E.P. Taylor, one of Canada's most powerful businessmen, acquired over 800 ha of farmland here. From 1953 to 1965, Taylor's companies transformed the farmland into one of the world's most innovative ""New Towns"", complete with 28,000 residents, over 70 industries, one of Canada's earliest suburban shopping plazas, schools, and recreation facilities. Don Mills was the first North American land development of its kind to be entirely planned and funded by the private sector. Its master plan was designed by Macklin Hancock in consultation with some of the world's leading urban planners. Centred around a common commercial and civic area, neighbourhoods are isolated from heavy traffic by looping roads and culs-de-sac. Light industry was welcomed on the edges of the plan. In an effort to create a landmark Modernist community, careful attention was paid to everything from the architectural style and position of buildings to their exterior materials and colours. Existing trees were retained wherever possible and generous green space was provided.

The Don Mills LegacyDon Mills has become one of the most discussed planned communities in Canadian history. Challenged, on the one hand, by critics of sprawling suburban development, it has also received praise from around the world for its attempt to create a fully functioning town where residents can live, work, and play. The development's success inspired imitation. After Don Mills, large private developments became the norm, with developers assuming the costs for the construction of public infrastructure such as roads and services for water and sewage. The road system of traffic-calming culs-de-sac and looping streets, popularized here, became synonymous with the suburbs. The central commercial core in which you stand has changed over the years, with a major redevelopment beginning in 2007. Don Mills' striking master plan remains largely intact - a landmark in urban planning.",,Towns and Villages,,,Plaque,0.0

By 1870 Newtonbrook was considered a thriving village with more than 200 settlers establishing homes at these crossroads. As early as 1801, Newtonbrook claimed one of the first log schools in North York. The early 1800s also saw two mill sites along Yonge Street, the Playter Mill at Drewry and the Cummer Mills at present-day Cummer Avenue. The Cummer Mill site was operated by John Cummer and owned by his father Jacob of Willowdale. For years, many religious camp meetings were held at the mill site, some of which reportedly went on for days. Descendants of York Mill's Humberstone family also made their home in Newtonbrook. Having apprenticed with his father, Thomas Humberstone opened a pottery in 1835 on the west side of Yonge Street, south of Steeles were earthenware pitches, vases and bricks were manufactured. Some of the most popular inns and taverns were found in Newtonbrook including Finch's Hotel built in 1847 on the north east corner of what is now Finch Avenue. In 1857 the Newton Brook Wesleyan Methodist Church Congregation was formed and named after a local preacher, the name by which the community became known. Although a church wasn't erected until 1857, it's not the house of worship itself which is most remembered, but its parsonage, as it was the birthplace of Lester B. Pearson, elected Canada's Prime Minister in 1963. Today, little remains of early Newtonbrook.

The location was strategic, near major Indigenous trails to the northern Great Lakes, and considered defensible from naval attack. Simcoe named the town ""York,"" after Frederick Augustus, Duke of York, second son of King George III, who had recently won a military victory against the French.That same summer, Simcoe ordered his regiment, the Queen's Rangers, to begin clearing the site of trees. Surveyor Alexander Aitken mapped out a ten-block townsite bounded by present-day George, Adelaide, Berkeley, and Front Streets.Areas immediately east and west of the town became government and military reserves. Parcels of land on the edge of the town were granted to government officials, military officers, and settlers.By 1804, York and its surrounding area had a population of 1,013. The town included 75 wooden houses and a market near the present-day intersection of King and Jarvis Streets. Two red-brick Parliament Buildings stood south of present-day Front Street, between Berkeley and Parliament Streets. The Town of York was incorporated as the City of Toronto in 1834.

Here's what it says: The area known as 'The Junction' lies along an ancient Indigenous Peoples' trade route that followed the shoreline of what was once Lake Iroquois from modern-day Detroit to Montreal. In 1817, Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe built the Dundas Highway as a military road, to connect York, now Toronto, to the western end of Lake Ontario at Dundas, now part of Hamilton. The earliest businesses in the area were taverns catering to merchants travelling along this route. The Keele family established the Carlton Racecourse in the area and the first running of the Queen's Plate - Canada's oldest thoroughbred horse race - took place here in 1860. Following the arrival of the railroads in the 1880's, the old racetrack and surrounding area was developed by D.W. Clendenan. The Junction became a major industrial centre with businesses such as Heintzman Pianos, the Union Stockyards, Wilkinson Ploughs, Canada Cycle & Motor Company and the Campbell Mining Company. The town also had a Customs House so that local businesses could clear their railroad imports without having to go to Toronto. The Village of West Toronto Junction was founded in 1884 at the intersection of Dundas and Keele Streets. In 1889, it merged with the nearby villages of Carlton and Davenport, to become the Town of West Toronto Junction. It subsequently grew into the Town of Toronto Junction in 1892, then the City of West Toronto before it was amalgamated with the City of Toronto in 1909. Because of a wild reputation, and helped by the efforts of the temperance movement, the town voted, in 1903, to ban the sale of alcohol. The ban lasted until 1996 for most of the area and was completely removed in 2000. The Junction is home to the oldest purpose-built synagogue in Ontario and the city's first mosque (visited by Malcolm X in 1968) was located here. In the 1990's, the end of prohibition and the completion of a major streetscape improvement project revitalized the area and led to the economic and cultural rebirth of The Junction.",,Towns and Villages,,,Plaque,0.0

The district was first occupied by British workers, then by Jewish immigrants who converted the Victorian houses into small family-run stores by adding makeshift ground-floor shops. As a result, the area was known for decades as the Jewish market.

Joseph Shepard was one of the earliest settlers to Lansing, building a log cabin in 1798 on the north west corner of these crossroads.

In 1866, a post office opened in the store and was called Lansing, thereby giving the community its name. Beginning in 1921, the Dempsey Brothers ran a thriving hardware business for more than 75 years. In 1996, the Shepard/Dempsey store was moved from its original location to a nearby park setting. Joseph Shepard also built a clapboard house in 1835 on today's Burndale Avenue which became a regular meeting place for the reform radicals of William Lyon Mackenzie, leader of the failed Rebellion of 1837. During the uprising, Joseph's wife, Catherine tried to shelter Colonel Van Egmond, one of Mackenzie's soldiers from government troops. As a reprisal to her, Loyalists set fire to the house. She managed to put out the fire, but her rebel friend was apprehended and jailed. The Golden Lion Hotel built in 1825 by Thomas Shepard, son of Joseph, once stood directly across from the original site of the Shepard Store. It was a much-frequented place, serving for a time as a Sunday School and a place for Mackenzie's reform members to congregate.

What happened, I think, to get the myth going was that Ontario Highway 11 used to also begin at Toronto's lakeshore and, over the years, the two, Yonge Street and Highway 11, became almost synonymous in people's minds. Highway 11 does run all the way to Rainy River; Highway 11, not Yonge Street. By the way, in the late 1990s the Conservative government cut back on its highway network, turning many highways and parts of highways over to municipalities. As a result Highway 11 no longer starts in Toronto. Its southern end is now Barrie.

He founded York (Toronto) in 1793, then ordered a road built to replace native trails which led north to Lake Simcoe and its water links with Lake Huron. Completed on February 16, 1796, it was named after British Secretary for War Sir George Yonge, an expert on Roman roads.

Here's what it says: Yorkville has been a vital centre for public transit for more than 150 years. The first transit, in 1849, was a horse-drawn omnibus service owned by cabinetmaker and carriage builder H. Burt Williams. His vehicles carried passengers and mail on a fixed route between St. Lawrence Hall, at King and Jarvis Streets, and the Red Lion Inn, at Yonge and Bloor Streets. The inn was a landmark in the independent Village of Yorkville.In 1861, the City of Toronto awarded the Toronto Street Railway a franchise to build and run the city's first streetcar line. These first streetcars were horse-drawn, built in Philadelphia, USA, and decorated with images of Toronto landmarks. The line, tracing the route of Williams' bus service, contributed to Yorkville's growth. Toronto annexed Yorkville in 1883.The streetcar lines were electrified in the 1890s. The Yonge streetcar line became the busiest in the city, prompting construction of Canada's first subway. Operated by the publicly owned Toronto Transit Commission, it opened in 1954.

Only a few years later, the first railway tracks along the lakeshore were laid here, in 1855 for the Hamilton and Toronto Railway. As a result, the landscape at this location was again altered by the construction of a viaduct to carry trains over the river. The railways on the viaduct above have carried generations of passengers, and tonnes of freight, to and from such places as Windsor, Niagara Falls, and New York City.

A log viaduct was constructed in 1824, then replaced by a swing bridge in the 1840s. With the decline of shipping on the river in the 1850s, the swing bridge was replaced by a fixed bridge.

4345,8499,Spadina Expressway,,,,43.666634,-79.403697,http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Spadina_Expressway1.html,,,,Plaque,http://torontoplaques.com,"This set of three historical plaques, erected by Heritage Toronto in 2010, is located here at the southeast corner of Spadina Avenue and Bloor Street. A set of three plaques identical to these three can be found further north outside the Dupont Subway Station on the northwest corner of Spadina Avenue and Dupont Street. Here's what they tell us: Spadina ExpresswayIn the 1960s, this stretch of Spadina Road was to be transformed into the southern end of a sunken, four- to six-lane expressway and a subway line. They would connect downtown Toronto with Highway 401, but the expressway would require the destruction of neighbourhoods and parkland along its route. The Spadina Expressway and subway line were one part of a much larger plan to manage traffic congestion in and around Toronto. Already part of the City's master plan in 1943, new ""superhighways"" responded to projections of dramatic suburban growth and the increasing use of the automobile to bring commuters to and from downtown. Shortly after the formation of the Municipality Metropolitan Toronto in 1953, construction of a system of expressways began with the Gardiner Expressway. Metropolitan Toronto Council approved the Spadina Expressway and subway line in 1962.

""Stop Spadina Save Our City""For many people, the Spadina Expressway was necessary for Toronto to adapt to modern needs. For others, it promised only the destruction of homes and parks, more traffic congestion, and pollutants from automobile exhaust. Citizen-led efforts against the expressway grew into the ""Stop Spadina Save Our City Coordinating Committee"" in 1969. This committee argued that the negative impact of the expressway and its soaring costs were not justified by a faster drive to and from downtown Toronto - itself a short-term gain because increasing traffic from suburban and urban growth would soon overwhelm and clog the expressway. The committee argued instead for better public transit. The Stop Spadina committee could not convince Metropolitan Toronto Council to cancel the expressway, and then lost a legal challenge in 1970 to cut off funding for its completion. A final appeal to the Government of Ontario, however, was a stunning success. Amidst great controversy, Premier William Davis cancelled the Spadina Expressway on June 3, 1971.

After the Spadina ExpresswayThe cancellation of the Spadina Expressway in 1971 left a section completed from Wilson Avenue in the north to Lawrence Avenue in the south. Now known as the William R. Allen Road, the expressway was opened to Eglinton Avenue in 1976, while the Spadina subway line was completed along the planned route of the expressway in 1978. The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway project was a landmark in the development of the City of Toronto. It signalled the end to plans for the other expressways which were to be cut through existing neighbourhoods. The Stop Spadina movement also helped give a voice to citizens in the planning of their neighbourhoods, and encouraged greater respect for the historic urban fabric during a period of intense redevelopment. Newly elected municipal politicians influenced by the Spadina Expressway fight and other movements of civic activism would shape the City of Toronto in the 1970s.",,Transportation,,,Plaque,0.0

It was designed in the 1940s as a commuter facility in an era when people were expected to live in the suburbs and work downtown, and it was controversial from the beginning. It was completed south to Lawrence Avenue by 1966. By the late 1960s, opposition became so intense that ""Stop Spadina"" became a rallying cry. The effective end of the Spadina came on June 3rd 1971 when the Hon William G. Davis, then Premier of Ontario, announced in the legislature that ""If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start.

Here's what it tells us: You are walking through the Teamway, now a pedestrian passageway running along the west side of the York Street ""subway"" or tunnel and underneath the railway viaduct. In earlier days, goods arriving by train at Union Station were unloaded and transferred to the Canadian National Express Building, a depot for transshipment, located above and beside where you are now standing. Here, horse-drawn wagons picked up the items from teamways or loading bays for delivery.Owing to the decline in rail traffic in the last decade, many of the tracks in the Railway Lands have been removed. This has opened up the area for new development. In 1995, nearly half of the York Street subway was demolished. The renovation of the Teamway began in 1997 as part of the York Street Gateway Project, a joint venture involving the federal and provincial governments (Canada/Ontario Infrastructure Works), the City of Toronto and Marathon Developments Inc., to improve pedestrian connections between Toronto's downtown and its harbourfront.The area between Front Street and the harbourfront has changed significantly during the course of local history. At one time, the shoreline of Lake Ontario was at Front Street. With the founding of the Town of York (Toronto) in 1793, came European settlement and the development of the waterfront. By the 1840s, much of the original beach along the shoreline had been replaced by piers constructed for passengers and cargo ships. By the 1850s, there was also considerable development of railways in Toronto. The Esplanade Act of 1853 granted the right-of-way along the shore to the Grand Trunk Railway, which proceeded to fill in this area to provide land for tracks. Thus began the southward expansion of land into the lake. The construction of privately owned wharfs also continued, and the shoreline gradually moved southward until, by 1900, it was more then 300 metres (984 feet) south of its original line. Starting in 1913, a further southward expansion was undertaken by the Toronto Harbour Commissioners. The location of Toronto's shoreline today is a result of the THC's ongoing lakefilling activities.In the early days, as now, the railway tracks divided the central business district of Toronto from the waterfront. In order to help solve the problem of pedestrians having to cross the tracks at grade level, a bridge was constructed at York Street in 1896/97. By 1909, the Dominion Board of Railway Commissioners had ordered the construction of a railway viaduct, thus allowing people and vehicles to move under the railway tracks through subways. However, disagreements delayed completion until 1931. The York Street Bridge was dismantled in 1927 to make way for the present day Union Station, and the York Street subway was opened in 1931. At 213 metres (700 feet), it was the longest subway in Toronto.Teamway ArtworkThe artwork in this pedestrian passageway reflects the evolution of the Teamway from the shores of Lake Ontario to Union Station. Ten major elements, focusing mainly on Anishnawbe (or Ojibway) cosmology, have been incorporated into the ""art on the floor"".

Thanks to contributor Wayne Adam for informing me about it. Here's what it says: This naturalistic ravine park setting know as Philosopher's Walk was once host to Taddle Creek, which over time has become 'lost' to Toronto's citizens. Taddle Creek flowed south for approximately 6 km from its source area on the edge of the old Glacial Lake Iroquois shoreline near St. Clair Avenue where it joined the Don River as it entered Toronto harbour near the Distillery District. Water quality was maintained by natural vegetation covering the watershed and aquatic organisms in the stream course. Taddle Creek provided habitat for fish and wildlife and a gathering place for Toronto's early inhabitants, notable the Ojibway.As a result of the damming of McCaul's Pond to the south, impeding the natural flow of Taddle Creek, and contamination that polluted the river and brought about the risk of typhus and other disease, the creek was buried south of College Street by the 1850's and north of Bloor Street by the 1870's. The old town of York had grown and the surrounding neighbourhoods had intensified, making an underground sanitation and sewage system a priority. The part of Taddle Creek remaining at the surface on University lands was diverted to this subterranean system and buried by 1884. The topography of this ravine remains as a tangible reminder of Taddle Creek, with the dips and valleys defining the original river banks and the walkway itself following much the same path as the 'lost river'.",,Rivers and Waterways,,,Plaque,0.0

It was designed by George M.

Their tireless efforts raised funds from individuals, the City of Toronto, and congregations far and wide to buy the site from the University of Toronto, furnish the residence, and later help with its upkeep. The building itself, which originally boasted a gymnasium, infirmary, and dining room in addition to residence facilities, was financed in large part by a gift from the estate of Hart M. Massey (father of Lillian) whose generosity to Victoria also made possible the later construction of Burwash Hall for men. In late August, 1988, the building was closed for a year of major renovation and restoration work during which the dining room and kitchen areas were converted to bedroom space thus enabling more students to experience residence life at Victoria.

Here's what the plaques say: For perhaps thousands of years before modern highways, overland trails connected the lower and upper Great Lakes. One of those trails began near here, at the mouth of the Humber River. The trail's Aboriginal names are forgotten, but early Europeans called it ""le Passage de Toronto"" and the ""Toronto Carrying Place.""The Toronto Carrying Place trail followed the east crest of the Humber Valley, avoiding its swampy lowlands and water crossings to connect with the Holland River as it entered Lake Simcoe. An alternate route to Lake Simcoe followed the Rouge River watershed, while still more footpaths from Lake Ontario's north shore followed other major river systems. Their routes varied according to the seasons and according to the interests of the traveller.In the 1600s, the route up the Humber became increasingly import due to the lucrative fur trade with newly arrived Europeans. The Huron-Wendat First Nation, traders with the French, lived at the trail's north end.  In the 1670s, their rivals, the Five Nations Iroquois, established villages near the Lake Ontario trailheads to control the flow of goods. This included the village of Teiaiagon here on the Humber River. By 1700, the Anishinaubeg-speaking people known as the ""Mississaugas"" had taken control of the area.Beginning in the 1670s, the government of New France, stationed in Quebec, established trading posts on the Great Lakes to convince First Nations to trade with them, and not with the British further to the south. Le Portage de Toronto became a key supply route for French posts on the upper Great Lakes and, in 1720, the French built their first trading post here as a branch of their larger post at Niagara. After the French lost this area to the British in the Treaty of Paris (1763), a French trader, Jean-Bonaventure Rousseaux and his son, Jean-Baptiste, came here to trade with Aboriginal peoples using the trail. In the late 1780s, the British acquired the land along the Carrying Place trail from the Mississaugas, and planned the Town of York (now Toronto) east of the Humber River's mouth.  Vital to so much of the history of this area, the Toronto Carrying Place was used less by Europeans after Yonge Street reached Lake Simcoe in 1796. While much of this ancient trail has been lost to modern development, it can still be traced along city streets and country paths that follow portions of its route.

Here's what it says: Near this location, a major stream once wove its way through the St. George Campus of the University of Toronto. Known as ""Taddle Creek"", the watercourse followed from headwaters in present-day Wychwood Park, off Bathurst Street, and followed a course that meandered south and southeast to enter Lake Ontario near Parliament Street. Taddle Creek was used by aboriginal peoples and European settlers as a navigation route and for drinking water. ""University Creek"", the watercourse, was a source of delight for the university. With the growth of the city, the creek became a popular location for fishing, skating and other recreational pursuits. In 1859, part of Taddle Creek was dammed to create McCaul's Pond (now site of Hart House Green) and a botanical garden.Beginning in the mid 19th century the urbanization of Toronto led into sections of Taddle Creek being buried or channelled into the city's sewer system. The watercourse was completely buried in 1884. Today, Philosopher's Walk, winding through the north end of the campus from Bloor Street West to Hoskin Avenue, is the only visible remnant of the former Taddle Creek ravine.

Here's what it tells us: The lower Don River used to meander through woods and marshes before discharging into both Toronto harbour and Ashbridge's Bay Marsh, one of the Great Lakes' largest coastal wetlands. As the city expanded closer to the river, the Don's natural cycle of flooding became a problem. The slow-moving river and its marshy banks also became heavily polluted and, by the 1870s, were considered a threat to public health. In response, the City's 1886 Don Improvement Plan channelized the lower Don River to both speed up and contain its flow, creating new industrial and transportation corridors along its banks. By 1892, the river had been straightened, widened, and deepened from near Gerrard Street to the lake. As a result of this plan, more river valley land became available for development. The plan, however, did not fulfill its promise of bringing shipping to the Don. It also failed to improve sanitary conditions and prevent flooding, largely because it did not consider the full complexity of the Don River's natural hydrology.

Here's what they say: Plan of Toronto BayToronto Bay at one time contained a rich diversity of fish and wildlife habitats. Historically these included the shallow nearshore zone along the north shore, the many lagoons and bays of Toronto Islands and the large Ashbridge's Marsh east of the mouth of the Don River. Salmon, pike and pickerel were among the many fish species to be found in its clear waters. Grey wolves, black bears, red and black foxes were abundant, as were golden eagles and various species of falcon and owls. These inhabited the ravines of the rivers and streams and the shores of the bay.The Toronto Islands at the time were long spits of sand and trees, connected by a long peninsula to the shoreline. The 1793 illustration indicates the many streams that fed the bay, such as Garrison Creek (so named owing to neighbouring Fort York), Russell Creek and Taddle Creek, whose bend was the site of the original Town of York.Europeans and First Nations peoples alike both relied on the fresh, clear waters for sustenance: in the bay fish would be speared in summer and winter; the streams and wells were used for drinking water and for brewing.Today, Toronto Bay consists of a highly urbanized north shoreline and the extensive parklands of the Toronto Islands.The original shoreline disappeared over a long period of landfill (approximately from the 1850's to the 1930's), effectively pushing the north shore southwards to where we stand today. This was in order to accommodate the arrival of the railways during the 1850's and the establishment of the Toronto Bay as a major commercial and transportation centre for Upper Canada.In addition, many of the surface streams that fed Toronto Bay have been buried and channelized as part of the city's sewer system.The north shore now is characterized by a series of landfill embayments bordered by vertical dockwalls and a deep water nearshore zone. The existing conditions along the north shore have not been conductive to fish and wildlife habitat. However, with regeneration and the ongoing efforts to clean the bay's waters there are considerable benefits, most notable is the return of one of the most productive and biologically diverse areas in the lake system.

Historic Toronto BayIf you were to look diagonally north and west of this location, beyond the Gardiner Expressway and to the former railway lands east of Bathurst St. and south of Front St. you would encounter the original shoreline of Lake Ontario, as depicted here.The image to the right is an interpretive rendering of what the shoreline conditions of Toronto were like prior to European settlement. Toronto Bay was bordered by tall stands of an oak forest stretching from where Fort York was to be established, eastward towards the mouth of the Don River. The dense forest is here interrupted by the mouth of Garrison Creek.Sailing along the Bay 200 years ago, one would have encountered not only salmon in Garrison Creek, but also loons in the bay. Rushes and reeds bordered the sandy shoreline.Governor John Graves Simcoe and his wife arrived on the shores of Toronto Bay on July 30th, 1793. Mrs. Simcoe observed the following,""We went in a boat two miles [eastward] to the bottom of the bay and walked through a grove of fine Oaks where the town [of York] is intended to be built. A low spit of land covered with wood forms the bay and breaks the horizon of the lake which greatly improves the view which indeed is very pleasing. The water in the bay is beautifully clear and transparent.""They settled near Fort York. The 'creek' Mrs. Simcoe refers to below is Garrison Creek, and the 'clearing' took place near the extreme left of this rendering.""The Queen's Rangers are encamped opposite to the ship. After dinner we went on shore to fix on a spot whereon to place the canvas houses and we chose a rising ground divided by a creek from the camp which is ordered to be cleared immediately. The soldiers have cut down a great deal of wood to enable them to pitch their tents.""The illustration at the far left indicates the original military encampment (Fort York) ten years after Lady Simcoe's journal entry. The great oak trees were cut down, leaving large stumps. The mouth of Garrison Creek was deepened and a wharf added.",,Rivers and Waterways,,,Plaque,0.0

The victories forced the Iroquois to return to their traditional lands in what is now upstate New York. After a successful French-led expedition against a Seneca village on the Humber in 1687 or 1688, the Mississaugas built a seasonal village on the west bank of the river and used it for summer hunting, fishing and farming. In the winter, the Mississaugas would move north along the Carrying-Place Trail to hunt for food and furs.By the mid 1800s, encroaching settlements disturbed this balanced, seasonal way of life and pressured the Mississaugas to relocate.Mississaugas of the New CreditTransCanada TrailOntarioToronto 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am

Here's what the plaques say: Urban development, including the creation of grassy public parks, has left us few places to experience the Humber Valley in its natural state. You are now standing between two such places: a marsh and an oak savannah. When humans first walked into the Toronto region as early as 11,000 years ago, they likely found a spruce parkland and open tundra landscape. The local climate and vegetation had changed by approximately 7000 years ago to resemble today's conditions, although the shoreline of Lake Ontario was about 500 metres south of its current location. The marsh at the mouth of the river was first formed perhaps 5,000 years ago, when the water level of Lake Ontario approached its current elevation, and the Humber River slowed here to meet it. The marsh's wide range of plants, fish, waterfowl, and mammals made it a vital seasonal hunting, fishing, and gathering site for Aboriginal peoples. Further up this path, a black oak savannah is a rare remnant of an ecosystem that once flourished around the lower Humber River area on the dry, sandy soils of the bottom of former Lake Iroquois (which preceded Lake Ontario 12,000 years ago). Oak, white pine, and sassafras trees grew in small groups across a savannah of grasses and low shrubs. This vegetation was subject to frequent fires, helping to maintain the ecosystem. Though significantly reduced in size and altered by both the loss of some species and the introduction of others, the remnants of both the marsh and the oak savannah have survived pollution, landfill, residential development, a previous golf course, and the construction of the adjacent Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant. Efforts continue towards the protection and regeneration of these remnant native ecosystems.",,Rivers and Waterways,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what the plaques say: You now stand at the intersection of two ancient ""shared paths"", each thousands of years older than the nearby modern highways. One route travelled along the shifting shoreline of Lake Ontario. The second, a roughly 50 kilometre-long footpath known today as the Carrying Place trail - an ancient forerunner of Yonge Street and Highway 400 - ran north along the banks of the Humber River to Lake Simcoe. Following natural contours, these trails were perhaps in use shortly after people first arrived in this area, about 11,000 years ago. Much later, ancestors of today's Huron-Wendat Nation, Six Nations of the Grand River, and Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation established communities along the Humber path.In the late 1500s and early 1600s, fur-trading with newly arrived Europeans gave the Humber path even greater strategic significance. After 1649-1650, the Huron-Wendat lost this area to the Five Nations Iroquois, who built a well-defended village near today's Bloor Street crossing. By 1700, the Mississaugas had replaced the Five Nations village with their own. French trading posts at the mouth of the Humber River followed, the first being built in 1720.  While people of Aboriginal, European and Métis descent continued to use the trail, a new era of European settlement began with the British founding of the Town of York (now Toronto) in 1793, not far from the mouth of the Humber.In the 1800s, the river became a hub of water-powered industry, and agricultural and residential development followed. The Humber watershed was dramatically altered, with deforestation changing its water levels, pollution destroying its fishery, and landfill changing its river banks - including here at the river's mouth. Fortunately, archaeological remains have survived to tell us of the river's vibrant, ancient history. Pollutants have been gradually reduced since the 1940s, causing natural ecosystems to regenerate in areas along its banks. In recognition of the Humber River's rich human history, it was declared a ""Canadian Heritage River"" in 1999.  Critical to our history, the Humber River is enjoyed today by people from all over the world.

The original 32 cottage flats - arranged around the grass courtyard - and six townhouses were designed in the English Cottage style with street level entrances and arched brick porches. In 1925, the architectural firm of Mathers and Haldenby designed an additional 40 flats on Sumach Street with steep shingled roofs and half-timbered gables.

4132,8280,Stables of Sir Henry Mill Pellatt's Casa Loma,,,,43.679225,-79.410703,http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Stables_of_Sir_Henry_Mill_Pellatt.html,,,,Plaque,http://torontoplaques.com,"At 330 Walmer Road are the former stables for Casa Loma. This plaque, inside the building, is attached to the wall opposite the stalls, to the right of the door beside the tack rooms. Here's what it says: The northern part of the Casa Loma Estate, comprising the Hunting Lodge, Potting Shed, Greenhouses and the Stables complex was begun in 1905 by builder Herbert Elgie, according to the design of the prominent Toronto architect E.J. Lennox. Sir Henry Pellatt, one of Edwardian Canada's wealthiest men, was a prominent industrialist, financier and military officer of the Queen's Own Rifles Regiment. He took up residence in the Hunting Lodge with his wife Mary in 1906, and watched as their permanent home, Casa Loma, was constructed across the street between 1911-1913. The Stables complex was the first building erected on the estate, and accommodated Pellatt's Thoroughbreds, Hackneys, Clydesdales and Percherons, as well as his much loved 'chargers' Prince and The Widow. An impressive structure, the Stables features red brick construction, cast stone trim and a Mannerist-inspired design that owes much to the stables of large European houses. Situated around a central courtyard, the two elaborate entrance blocks are the main features of the L-shaped complex. The northerly doorway opens into the Stables, while the westerly doorway opens into the Garage. Both entrances feature heavily blocked engaged columns that support heraldic beasts and the Pellatt crest. Other notable elements include a stone squirrel (representing industry) and the QOR Regimental insignia on the Stables tower. The Stables served not only as accommodation for horses and carriages but provided small apartments for the stable hands and groomsmen on the upper floors. Beneath the stables were rooms for propagating mushrooms, asparagus and rhubarb. The interior of the ground level of the Stables features a carriage room with wooden trusses, walls clad in the regimental colours of the Queen's Own Rifles, mahogany stalls and Spanish tile flooring. The stalls still bear the names of Pellet's much loved horses- Casa Loma Belle, Prince Highgate (Prince), Matchless (of Londesborough), Lord Kitchener, The Widow and Indian Chief. Some of these horses were carriage horses, and others saddle horses, but almost all had won numerous coveted prizes and championships throughout North America. The ribbons that they had won covered one wall of the Stables, and the trophies collected filled a room. Matchless and Lord Kitchener were registered Hackney Horses and the latter had never been beaten in the show ring. Indian Chief, grandson of the famous American racehorse Hanover, was a young chestnut Thoroughbred who was schooled in dressage by Pellatt's stable manager, Thomas Cushing. The Widow was the only Canadian bred horse in the stables and was a much-loved mount, accompanying Pellatt twice to Britain for military maneuvers. When Pellett moved out of Casa Loma for the last time in 1923, his horses moved with him to the fine accommodations of Mary Lake. Mary Lake was Pellatt's country estate where he raised prize-winning cattle, sheep, horses and fowl, and was situated in King Township, a half an hour north of Toronto. In 1936, The Kiwanis Club of West Toronto (later known as the Kiwanis Club of Casa Loma) entered into a lease agreement with the City of Toronto, who had acquired the estate from Pellatt for non-payment of property taxes. In 1937, the property was opened to the public as a heritage attraction. Who would have imagined that a short time later the Stables would serve as a top secret location for the assembly of a newly developed technology. ASDIC, named for its inventors, stands for Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee. It was an early form of sonar and could detect a U-boat at a distance of 8 km. This device enabled Allied naval vessels to search for and destroy enemy submarines. As the original production site for ASDIC had been bombed in London, a new assembly location was found in 1941 in the Casa Loma Stables. Little did the touring public realize that behind a small padlock and a sign which read ""Construction in progress-sorry for the inconvenience"" ASDIC was being secretly assembled. The ASDIC project continued at Casa Loma until the end of the war, with only a few members of the Kiwanis Club being privy to the secret. Although Sir Henry had passed away in 1939 he surely would have been proud to have known the essential role that his Stables had played in the victory of the Allied Forces in the Second World War.",,Residential Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: How did Grenadier Pond come to be? The answer dates back to the last ice age. Around 20,000 years ago this location was covered by an ice sheet 1 km thick. Over the millennia it slowly melted, forming the huge Lake Iroquois - 95 m deeper than its successor, Lake Ontario. The steep slope at Davenport Road, 8 km north of here, marks its original shoreline (see letter A on the map).As the ice age ended, the waterways readjusted, causing the shoreline to recede by 5 to 10 km (see B). Later the continent's landmass rebounded and the shoreline expanded again, eventually forming Lake Ontario as we know it today (see C). Water flowing from the north carved through deposits of sand and gravel left by the retreating glacier, deepening old rivers and creating new watercourses such as Wendigo Creek and Spring Creek.About 2,000 years ago, a sandbar closed the mouth of Wendigo Creek, and the trapped water became Grenadier Pond. Over time, the pond occasionally broke through to reconnect with the lake as water levels fluctuated with the seasons. When Toronto expanded in the 1800s, railway beds and roadways built along the lakeshore created a permanent barrier, and the pond's outflow was redirected through a weir west to the Humber River.",,Rivers and Waterways,,,Plaque,0.0

Working in a factory across the street from here, he invented an effective AC tube, then designed around it the world's first batteryless radio receiver. Following its debut in August 1925, the Rogers Batteryless Radio was quickly copied by American and European manufacturers.

Three years later he was transferred to Toronto. During 1843-44 Lefroy conducted the first comprehensive magnetic and meteorological survey in British North America, making observations of exceptional scope and scientific value. Before returning to England in 1853 he was instrumental in persuading the provincial government to assume responsibility for the observatory.

He was highly regarded by his colleagues and well liked by all his students. This geodetic observatory was built in 1908 to support those programs. Laid out by Stewart himself, it was made with masonry from the old Toronto magnetic and meteorological observatory, which was demolished in 1907.

Here's what they tell us: Babe Ruth at Hanlan's PointNear this site, in Maple Leaf Park on September 5, 1914, the now legendary baseball player Babe Ruth hit his first home run as a professional. It was to be the only home run he ever hit in the minor leagues.As a 19-year-old rookie, playing for the Providence Grays in the International League, he connected with a pitch from Ellis Johnson of the Toronto Maple Leafs, sending the ball over the fence in right field and scoring three runs. Pitching for the Grays, Ruth allowed only one hit, earning the title ""southside phenom"" from the Toronto Daily Star. The final score was Providence Grays 9, Toronto Maple Leafs 0. Babe Ruth quickly moved up to the major leagues, and played his way to a phenomenal career. The Toronto team went on to win a total of eleven pennants before folding in 1967.

In 1910, the baseball team, now called the Toronto Maple Leafs, replaced its wooden stadium with a concrete, 18,000-seat structure named Maple Leaf Park.

Here's what it says: The Maple Leafs were in first place, the football season was in full swing, and the local sports calendar was mighty crowded. So forgive Toronto for treating a moment of history as a mere curiosity. On November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies opened the inaugural season of the Basketball Association of America at Maple Leaf Gardens, playing the New York Knickerbockers on a newly constructed wooden floor and showing off a radical innovation - transparent backboards. Fifty-five years before, basketball had been invented by a Canadian, Dr. James Naismith, and was popular in schools and at the YMCA. Ads for the first Huskies' game touted it as the ""World's Most Popular Sport!"" and ""King Basketball - Canada's Own Sport."" But this new, professional version of the game was alien to the city, and only 7,090 fans, not all of them paying customers, turned out to watch the Huskies lose 68-66. ""On the play our Huskies appeared short on both conditioning and competition,"" the Toronto Star reported. The losing would continue. A month into the season, player-coach ""Big"" Ed Sadowski, a future all-star, was gone, and by the following spring, after finishing last, so was the franchise, having cost its owners $100,000 in losses. But history was indeed made that first night. Though there were professional basketball teams in the United States dating all the way back to 1895, and other leagues had come and gone, the National Basketball Association - which was created when the BAA merged with the rival National Basketball League in 1949 - considers the first Huskies game as the first in its history. And Frank Biasatti from Windsor, Ont., the only Canadian on the floor that night, is recorded as the NBA's first ""international"" player. Other basketball games were played at Maple Leaf Gardens through the years, including many appearances by the Harlem Globetrotters, a series of regular season Buffalo Braves NBA games, college exhibitions, the 1994 World Basketball Championship, and occasional appearances by the Toronto Raptors before the construction of the Air Canada Centre.-Stephen Brunt",,Sports,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it tells us: The Royal Canadian Bicycle Club was one of the most successful early cycling organizations in Toronto. Founded in 1891, the club dominated road racing around the turn of the century, winning the prestigious Dunlop Trophy team race nine times. Because repeat winners kept their prizes, between 1896 and 1902 the Royal Canadians took permanent possession of a six-foot silver trophy, two large shields, and a cup.In 1899, the Royal Canadians earned international recognition when the team finished first in a Dunlop Trophy race held in conjunction with the world cycling championships in Montreal. Many of the club's cyclists were also successful in provincial and national competitions organized by the Canadian Wheelmen's Association.As road racing declined in popularity, the club focused on other sports, such as hockey and soccer. In the early 1900s, they won local baseball championships at Sunlight Park near Queen Street East and Broadview Avenue, and also excelled in city 10-pin bowling leagues.The Royal Canadians built this clubhouse in 1906, installing a cornerstone in 1907. There were four bowling lanes, a library, a dining room, and an assembly hall. An ice rink was added at the rear in 1929 for hockey, skating, and curling.The club gradually committed solely to curling and became the Royal Canadian Curling Club in 1954.

Here's what it says: In March 1966, the heavyweight boxing champion of the world had been blacklisted. Muhammad Ali - whom many still insisted on calling Cassius Clay - was undefeated, at the peak of his powers, and scheduled to defend his title against Ernie Terrell in Chicago. When the Illinois commission denied its sanction because Ali refused to honour the draft for the Vietnam War, every other American commission immediately followed suit.Montreal showed some interest, and then passed. By default, it came down to Toronto, where the co-owner of Maple Leaf Gardens, Harold Ballard, rolled out the welcome mat. (Because a ""draft dodger"" was allowed to do business in the building he had constructed, Conn Smythe, a veteran of two World Wars, resigned from the board of directors and never crossed the threshold of his fabled arena again.) Terrell pulled out at the last minute, which left the promoters searching desperately for a replacement only 16 days before the fight. They didn't have to look far. George Chuvalo had begun his professional career at the Gardens a decade earlier, as house promoter Deacon Allen built his record and reputation, moving him into the top ten heavyweights in the world. But setbacks and disappointments, bad breaks and tough decisions, had taken their toll. When the call came to fight Ali, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.Chuvalo won only a couple of the 15 rounds, and absorbed tremendous punishment from Ali's lightning fists, but the son of immigrant parents, the pride of the Junction neighbourhood, the embodiment of a ""new"" Toronto, stood tall against a fighter who, in that moment, may well have been the greatest heavyweight of all time. He didn't flinch, he didn't take a backward step, and as was the case throughout his long and remarkable career, he never went down. Ali called him ""the toughest guy I ever fought.""

Here's what it says: Ace Bailey faced the man who had nearly killed him - and for a moment no one knew what would happen. Two months earlier, during a game at the Boston Garden, the Bruins' Eddie Shore took a run at Bailey and flattened him. The Leafs' winger fractured his skull when his head hit the ice. For days he hovered between life and death. Boston police threatened to charge Shore with manslaughter, and Bailey's distraught father boarded a train for Boston with a gun in his pocket, intent on killing the man he believed had killed his son. Bailey survived, though he would never play hockey again. On February 14, 1934, a team of NHL All-Stars, with Shore in the line-up, played the Maple Leafs at the Gardens, with the proceeds going to benefit Bailey and his family. It was announced that no Maple Leaf would ever wear Bailey's number six again - the first number ever retired in the NHL. During the pre-game ceremonies, Bailey came face to face with his attacker for the first time. After a tense few seconds, he extended his hand, and the Gardens crowd erupted in cheers. There were hopes that the exhibition would become an annual tradition, to benefit injured players. But that wouldn't happen until October 13, 1947, when the first official NHL All-Star Game was played at Maple Leaf Gardens. It was a rough night. Chicago's Bill Mosienko suffered a broken ankle after absorbing a hard check from the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson, and the Montreal defence tandem of Butch Bouchard and Ken Reardon mixed it up repeatedly with Toronto's Bill Ezinicki.

But on April 21, 1951, at Maple Leaf Gardens, when hard-hitting defenceman Bill Barilko pinched in on the left wing and fired a shot high on the stick side just before being knocked to the ice that beat Gerry McNeil and won the Stanley Cup, most of what would make the moment special was still to be revealed to the spoiled fans of the Toronto Maple Leafs. ""It was as clean as a hound's tooth,"" Red Burnett wrote of Barilko's shot in the Toronto Star. ""McNeil never had a chance."" Certainly it's not every day that you win the Stanley Cup, in overtime, on home ice. Barilko's teammates lifted him on to their shoulders in celebration, and in the papers, there was a picture of his mom, ladling him a drink out of the Stanley Cup. But that year every one of the six games in the finals against the Montreal Canadiens was decided in an extra period, and as for the Leafs winning championships...well, that was old hat. This was the greatest dynasty in the long history of the franchise, winning the Cup in 1945, 1947 and 1949, before the 1951 victory. But this was also the end. The following August, while returning home from a fishing trip, Barilko and a friend flying in a small plane disappeared over northern Ontario. He was just 24 years old. Their fate remained a mystery until 1962, when the remote crash site was finally discovered.

So secure was the belief in national superiority in the national game, that being humiliated by the Russians - who seemed to have somehow re-imagined how hockey could be played - was more like having the sun rise on the other side of the sky.And so a mere exhibition hockey series was instantly transformed into a contest in which it felt like an entire way of life was on the line.Game two at Maple Leaf Gardens provided blessed relief, restoring temporarily the old hockey order. Led by a stellar goaltending performance from Tony Esposito, the Canadian pros triumphed 4-1, delivering the comforting (and false) assurance that the result of the first game had been an aberration, a fluke, an off-night when Canada's heroes were simply caught unawares.""A smasheroo of a hockey game,"" Milt Dunnell dubbed it in the Toronto Star, writing that the difference in atmosphere between games two and one was ""the difference between a wedding and a wake.""The Canadians forechecked and hit the Russians, disrupting their intricate passing, seemingly discovering the key to unlocking the unique Soviet style. The highlight of the game was Peter Mahovlich's brilliant solo shorthanded goal in the second period, which came immediately after the Soviets had narrowed the score to 2-1, and appeared to have seized the momentum.The series moved on to Winnipeg, Vancouver ... and Moscow, and it would never again prove nearly so easy to Canada as it looked on that happy night at the Gardens.- Stephen Brunt",,Sports,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: Really, it couldn't have been better scripted - except for the ending. On May 29, 1993, the Toronto Maple Leafs were just one win away from a trip to the Stanley Cup finals, where they had not ventured since the triumph of 1967. Waiting for them were the Montreal Canadiens, their great historic rivals, in the midst of an unexpected playoff run that would eventually take them all the way to a championship. Twice already, the Maple Leafs had shown a flair for the dramatic, winning playoff series in the seventh game against the Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues, and their fans filled the streets in celebration. Now, with the Cup so close, the whole town seemed set to explode. Only one small problem for Doug Gilmour, Wendel Clark, Felix Potvin and company, the best Leafs team in a long, long time, and their inspirational head coach Pat Burns: sitting on the visitors' bench wearing the uniform of the Los Angeles Kings was Wayne Gretzky, arguably the greatest hockey player of all time. Leafs fans will tell you that they should have won the series in game six in Los Angeles - that they were robbed when Gretzky accidentally slashed Gilmour in the face in overtime, drew blood, somehow didn't receive even a minor penalty, and then scored the winner a few seconds later. In game seven, though, there was no real controversy. Gretzky was magnificent, scoring three times, but the Leafs refused to fold, fighting back again and again. In the final seconds, trailing 5-4, with the Gardens' crowd as loud as it had ever been during the building's long history, they pushed desperately for the tying goal, only to finally be denied. It was a heartbreaking finale to an unforgettable hockey spring in Toronto. So close. So agonizingly, tortuously, close.-Stephen Brunt",,Sports,,,Plaque,0.0

An industrial suburb with one of every four unemployed, tempers ran as hot as the record high temperatures of that summer. In response to the provincial government's cutbacks to relief programs, relief workers began to strike in June and by the end of the month there were more than five thousand on strike. There were deputations and angry demonstrations in Mimico, Long Branch, Lakeview and York and violence across the city and province. On July 8 two relief workers and Reeve Armstrong were seized and imprisoned off of the boiler room of the school. A crowd surrounded the school and swelled to 500. After being held for eighteen hours, the Reeve agreed to compromise relief benefits. Premier Hepburn was convinced that Communists had organized the province wide demonstrations. In the early hours of July 10 he dispatched a special squad of police, who arrested ten men on the charge of ""seizing and holding persons."" The arrests marked the end of the relief violence.",,Schools,,,Plaque,0.0

The architect realized a child's scale in the design of the school, resulting in lowered ceilings, blackboards, window sills and shelving. The official opening for the first section was in January 1943, followed by many visits by trustees and teachers from other areas and by stories in papers and journals here, in Great Britain and the United States. Parkin later designed many large modern public and commercial buildings for which he also received international acclaim. The original Sunny Lea school opened in 1908 on the east side of Prince Edward Drive to serve rural Etobicoke School Section 14, which extended from the Humber River to Islington Avenue, between Bloor Street and Berry Road.

Harris and Dr. James MacCallum erected the Studio Building on Severn Street (adjacent to this site) in 1913 to help artists 'concentrate their energies on making a Canadian statement in art in Canadian terms'.

Hurst was committed to putting art in public buildings. He looked at other hospitals before creating his proposal for Riverdale. Gatterbauer shared Hurst's commitment and enthusiasm. She wanted to create ""a very good work of art"" that would truly express the time for future generations.Gatterbauer prepared a full-size watercolour painting of the composition for approval before starting on the mosaic. The total cost, including design, was $17,000.The following poem, written in 1962 explains the mosaics symbolism.The Meaning of LifeThe SUN is the most important requisite for life on earth.The FAMILY group is the source of human life and the foundation of our civilization.MAN holding the planets symbolizes the source of strength, exploration, and discovery.WOMAN sitting on the earth symbolizes her duties and responsibilities for creation and family life.The CHILDREN protected by man and wife are God's trust and man's hope for the future.The ROCKS, EARTH, FOREST, and WATER were the beginning; after millions of years mankind developed a civilization.The giant step from man's first erectness to our present day life is symbolized in the mural by the RAINBOW as the connecting link between nature or primitive society to the floating city or present day civilization.FISH and BIRDS, WATER and SKY are our steady companions.The MOON is the reciprocation of the sun as night is to day.MOUNTAINS and ROCKS symbolize the obstacles over which we struggle to survive and conquer.",,Arts,,,Plaque,0.0

On November 4, 1993, the headliners were a trio from Seattle called Nirvana, playing in front of 8,500 fans in a scaled-down version of the Gardens. Only two years before, on the same day the album Nevermind was released - the record that would make them reluctant superstars - the band had played a brilliant, chaotic set at a small Toronto club in front of only a few hundred fans. Their style was dubbed grunge, a rough, edgy and dark rejection of the excesses of big, corporate rock, just as punk had been fifteen years earlier, and like so many acts before them, they were viewed as the musical voice of a disaffected generation. But now Nirvana were arena rockers themselves, who had sold millions upon millions of records, and it was hard not to sense their discomfort. The band's lead singer Kurt Cobain was described by Toronto reviewers as ""sullen"" onstage, and the band pointedly declined to perform its biggest hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit. As it turned out, Nirvana would never be back. Four months later, they played their last show in Munich. Five month later, Cobain was dead, a suicide at age 27.-Stephen Brunt",,Arts,,,Plaque,0.0

 The Souster Steps are named for one of Toronto's most beloved poets. Raymond Souster (1921-2012) lived for 17 years on Mayfield Avenue, nigh Willard Gardens Parkette - or ""Lollipop Park."" A devoted Swansea resident, Souster spent all but four years of his life in Toronto, his birth city. Over 60 years, Souster penned more than 50 poetry collections and edited many anthologies. Revered as the ""Dean of Toronto Poets,"" his verse - casual and inviting - always shows respect for everyday people and finds wisdom and whimsy in commonplace events.In 1952, Souster co-founded Contact Press, which published Margaret Atwood, Leonard Cohen, Gwendolyn MacEwen, and Milton Acorn, among others, early in their careers. In 1966, Souster helped to establish the League of Canadian Poets, serving as its first president. Souster tirelessly championed Canadian poetry, viewing it as a community art.Souster received the Governor General's Award for Poetry in 1964 and the City of Toronto Book Award in 1980.

Here's what it says: In 1889, architect James Augustus Ellis came to the Junction, just as the village had grown into a town. Over the next twenty years, working alone or with partners, Ellis designed over fifty buildings in the Junction area: factories, hotels, places of worship, public buildings, and many houses, including his own home. In his first year alone, Ellis worked on at least eleven Junction buildings. These early projects include two factories, and the houses of several prominent Junction citizens including that of the mayor, Daniel Webster Clendenan at 191 High Park Avenue.Today's Humberside Collegiate Institute was established in 1892 as ""Toronto Junction High School"" in the basement of Victoria Presbyterian Church on Annette Street. It moved to the current site on Humberside in 1894 with the construction of a new building designed by Ellis. In 1909, one year after the Junction became the City of West Toronto, the community held its celebration here when Toronto and West Toronto amalgamated. The auditorium includes a mural by Group of Seven artist Arthur Lismer. This work took 6 years to complete and is painted in oils on five canvas panels. The central panel shows Truth, Wisdom, Courage, Beauty, Innocence and Devotion while the other panels show representations of the various populations of Canada - Native, French and English.High Park Avenue was once home to some of the wealthiest and most important families in the Junction. Its tree lined boulevard reflects the ""City Beautiful"" movement of the late nineteenth century. 204 High Park Avenue was one of the many grand Junction houses designed by Ellis and is noted for its mixture of stone and red brick masonry. This house was designed for James T. Jackson in 1890; an early Junction real estate agent who co-founded the Junction's first newspaper in 1888. Also designed by Ellis and Connery and funded with a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, the Annette Street Library opened as the West Toronto Library in 1909. A condition of the Carnegie grant was that the library included public lecture rooms in its design. These are located in the basement and are still in use today. Ellis and Connery also designed the nearby Masonic Temple which opened shortly after the library. Like many other important Junction men of his day, Ellis was an active freemason.

George Michie (pronounced ""Mickey"") initially sold ""iron mongery,"" stovepipes, linens, dry goods, food stuffs, building materials, fine wine from France, and spirits from nearby Gooderham & Worts Distillery. His business thrived as the intersection of Yonge and King Streets evolved into the commercial centre of the rapidly growing city. By 1861, streetcar tracks were laid on both streets, providing patrons with easy access during and after work. Michie's original plain, Georgian-style, three-storey brick store was improved in 1893 with a more elaborate red-brick-and-sandstone structure. It was soon dwarfed by its neighbours: the 12-storey Dominion Bank (1914), the Canadian Pacific Railway Building (18 storeys, 1913) and the Royal Bank Building (20 storeys, 1915).

Michie's customers, whose names could be found in any book listing the country's Who's Who, made their way to the busy King and Yonge corner from all parts of the city and surrounding countryside. The transaction completed, servants would load the goods on wagons prior to the homeward trip to Rosedale, affluent Parkdale, or far off Richmond Hill. Michie's continued as a family run business until 1947 when John Forbes Michie, the grandnephew of founder George, sold the company to the Simpsons Company. At about the same time Michie's was opening its doors in Toronto, a baker named Marcel Thuet was setting up his shop ""Boulangerie Thuet"" in the Haut-Rhin region of Alsace, France. Out of this tiny village bakery comes the 200 year old starter that is still used in all Thuet breads today. Chef Marc Thuet and his wife Biana Zorich are proud to continue the legacy of a family-run retail food shop at 1 King West. Petite Thuet will provide exceptional products to Torontonians with the care that these two family histories inspire.",,Commercial Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

That vision reached fulfillment when the Sikorsky helicopter, nicknamed Olga, lifted the 44th and final piece of the CN Tower's antenna into place on April 2, 1975 making the tower the World's Tallest Free-Standing Structure at a height of 1815 feet and five inches or 553.33 metres.

The philosophers have laughed. The scientists have laughed.

The CHIN International Picnic, now a three-day festival, annually attracts more than 250,000 people to celebrate Toronto's cultural diversity.

In 1846 the Wesleyan Methodists of this area, led by Reverend T. Turner, built a small frame church amid the fields of Christie's farm. These settlers and their descendants worshipped here for 80 years. After the congregation was absorbed into the United Church in 1925, the chapel was closed.

Here's what it says: This cemetery opened in 1860 and was the third military burial ground in Toronto. It replaced one situated a short distance to the west, which was abandoned after a few burials and the bodies were moved to this location. The last known interment here was in 1911.The following is an extract from Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto, Vol. 1, 1894:There are about two hundred graves distinguishable by the mounds of earth. In the whole cemetery there are only twenty-eight stones or wooden slabs standing to tell who lies beneath. A few broken stories have fallen; most of them are indecipherable and the rest are nameless. All the headstones are of the simplest and plainest character. There is not a monument or shaft in the yard. On a few graves are simple wooden crosses without any inscription. Here and there is a square picketed enclosure about a grave, the fence in a very dilapidated condition and overgrown with grass, thistles and ivy. But one grave bears token that its occupant is still cherished in memory. The grave is that of Sergeant-Major F.W. Gathercole, of the Canadian School of Infantry, who died at the new fort, Toronto, February 13, 1883, aged forty-two years. A neat marble slab, simple but quite as pretentious as any in the cemetery, bears the inscription that it was erected by his comrades in affectionate remembrance. About the grave the grass and thistles have been cleared away, and four pots of geraniums in bloom had been placed on it. The stone marking the resting place of assistant Commissary-General, John Moirs McLean Sutherland, is broken and down. Everything about the grounds bears evidence that they are seldom visited. The proportion of soldiers drowned among the twenty-eight whose names are decipherable is large. They are John Manley Rattle, Deputy Assistant Commissary-General, J. Ramsey Akers, Ensign in the 16th Regiment, James Walsh, Private in the 30th Regiment, and Corporal John Smeeton, of the 13th Hussars. Several graves are those of the wives and children of soldiers. The head stones range in date, from 1860 down to that of Private E. A. Heath, of the Canadian School of Infantry, who died in 1885, being the most recent. Among the graves is one of Walter Toronto Lewis, the one-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Lewis, who died in 1868. The 13th Hussars has the greatest number of burials. At two graves are tiny marble slabs, not over five inches wide and a foot high, bearing simply the inscriptions: ""G. M. and G. F. S."". They are evidently remembered, for loving hands had recently propped up the broken and fallen memorials with pieces of wood. Most of the stones bear inscriptions to the effect that they were erected by comrades. But little attempt at decoration has been made on the slabs. Here and there is a flag, a pair of crossed swords, a wreath, a cross, a crown, and other usual emblems of this character all very simply executed. Among the dead who lie here are: Trumpeter James McMahon, 13th Hassars; Rachel, wife of Sergeant-Major William Ross, of the 4th Artillery; Isabella Thompson, Private George Miller, 13th Hussars, and Colour-Sergeant John Hanney, 47th Regiment.",,Cemeteries,,,Plaque,0.0

Construction of the hospital on its 24 scenic hectares beside Lake Ontario began in the 1880s, as a healthy respite facility for patients who would be transferred from the Province's existing asylums.The ""Mimico Branch Asylum"" opened on January 21, 1890 under the administration of the Asylum for the Insane, Toronto (later renamed the Queen Street Mental Health Centre). It received its first 116 patients on that day from Toronto, with the exception of ten male patient labourers who had been resident since 1889 to prepare the site for later occupants. In 1892, it was decided that the Mimico Asylum (so renamed) should become a fully integrated facility in its own right, rather than a ""long-stay patient only"" branch, which it remained until it closed and partially re-merged with the Queen Street facility in 1979.The first burial at this cemetery took place in 1890 and the last in 1974. For 84 years, the cemetery at Mimico was used to bury patients who had no family or lacked sufficient funds to make other arrangements. The cemetery was divided in half by a central north-south road. Roman Catholics where buried on the west side of the cemetery and the Protestants were buried primarily on the east side. The rows are marked at each end by a small square stone inscribed with a letter or number corresponding to the burial register. There are 50 graves per row, aligned two end to end, by 25 across.

This 2005 plaque has this to say: Richview Cemetery's oldest surviving monument records the death of Ann Garbutt who was interred in 1846, before the official establishment of this burial site. In 1853, William Knaggs sold this land from his farm for a chapel and lot without belonging to any particular church or denomination, to be respectively devoted exclusively to religious purposes in the discretion of certain trustees, namely Mark Dawson, Robert Coulter, and William Tuer. By 1850, the Union Chapel on the site had been joined by two other local congregations. The chapel and its cemetery served Richview, a small rural community bounded by present-day Dixon Road, Rathburn Road, Kipling Avenue, and Renforth Drive. Richview consisted of farms, a post office, blacksmith, church and school. In 1888, William and Sarah Knaggs donated additional property, south of the cemetery, upon which a new building, depicted above, was constructed. It was named Richview Methodist Church (later Richview United Church). The vast development of Highway 427 led to the relocation of the congregation in 1959, the demolition of the church building, and the dramatic surroundings of the cemetery today. In the 1970s the McFarlane family cemetery and the Willow Grove Burying Ground were moved from their original sites and relocated here.

Here's what it has to say: Toronto's first Roman Catholic Cemetery was beside St. Paul's Church in east downtown Toronto which was established as a Parish in 1822. This cemetery was rapidly filled as a result of the many deaths following the hardships suffered after the 1847 Irish potato famine. By the mid-1850's another catholic cemetery was needed to serve the growing number of Parishes in Toronto. Purchased in 1854 by the Bishop of Toronto, Rt. Rev. Armand Francois Marie, Comte De Charbonnel, St. Michael's Cemetery was opened in 1855 at the present location in Deer Park, then well north of the City of Toronto. His successor, Bishop John Joseph Lynch, enlarged the cemetery in 1866. To meet the needs of the ever increasing catholic population Mount Hope Cemetery was opened in 1900 in North Toronto. Originally St. Michael's Cemetery was administered by the Rector of St. Michael's Cathedral. The Toronto Catholic Cemetery Association assumed the responsibility in 1961.

The chapel, whose arch is the most prominent decorative feature, has a distinctly Gothic motif, including the large arched stained glass window lighting the nave and the arched rose window of stained glass lighting the sanctuary and chancel. An unique aspect of the chapel's architecture is the placement of the bell tower at the rear, over the sacristy, a sensible design for funeral processions entering through the porch and passing through the large nave to the chancel and finally through the sacristy to the cemetery grounds.

The buildings at 5 St. Joseph (built 1905-1907), 11 St. Joseph (built in two phases between 1895 and 1898), 9 St. Nicholas (1913), and the former stables and storehouse at 15 St. Nicholas were red brick buildings with restrained classical detailing. They formed a distinctive commercial enclave in the area northwest of Yonge and Wellesley Streets. Designed by the successive architectural firms of Dick and Wickson, A. Frank Wickson and Wickson and Gregg, the St. Joseph Street facades were noteworthy for their flat-headed, segmental and arched openings, decorative brickwork, strong cornices, and stone details. They exemplified commercial architecture of the 1890s in Toronto.Between 2002 and 2004, the site was redeveloped for residential use. The designated facades on St. Joseph and St. Nicholas Streets were carefully dismantled and reassembled in their original location to commemorate the original architecture of the site.",,Commercial Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

In 1891, when the Toronto Street Railway ceased operating, its successor, the Toronto Railway Company, took over the building and converted it to a steam power plant for the city's first regular electric streetcar service, which began in August 1892. A 76-metre chimney (now demolished) at the rear of the power plant was one of the tallest structures in Toronto in the 1890s. Photographers liked to take pictures of the city from the top of the chimney. In 1921, when the city-owned Toronto Transportation Commission absorbed the Toronto Railway Company, the building became a depot and warehouse.

Considered among our finest poets, Isabella Crawford was born in Ireland and came to Canada with her parents about 1858. After settling first in Paisley, Ontario, the family lived later in Lakefield and Peterborough. As a young woman Isabella became fascinated by backwoods life and Indian legends. Following her father's death, she and her mother moved to Toronto. There they subsisted on her meagre earnings from light verse and 'formula fiction' that appeared in Canadian and American newspapers. One privately-printed book of serious poetry, 'Old Spookeses Pass, Malcom's Katie and Other Poems' appeared before her untimely death at 57 John Street. Full recognition came later, however, with the publication of her collected poems, which were admired for their evocative images of the lush and sparkling wilderness.'Darkness built its wigwam walls close around the camp'",,Arts,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what they say: Though now away from the lake and nestled among the trees, this is the oldest surviving lighthouse on the Great Lakes and the second oldest surviving lighthouse in Canada. It was constructed in 1808-09 when this site was only eight metres from the shifting shoreline of Lake Ontario and exposed to violent lake storms. Guiding sailors into York (now Toronto) harbour, this lighthouse was also used to hoist flags signalling the approach of ships to the town and fort. At a time when most buildings in York were built with local materials, the lighthouse was constructed of stone from Queenston, near Niagara Falls. Its walls are almost two metres thick at the base, and were raised to their existing height by adding stone from Kingston in 1832. Its wick lamps, which were visible many kilometres out over the lake, were fuelled with hundreds of litres of whale oil per year, then coal oil, until an electric light was installed in 1917. In 1809, the lighthouse was the only major light on York's dark, forested horizon. In 1945, the light was changed from white to green to distinguish it from the bright lights of the modern city. The Gibraltar Point Lighthouse was once accompanied by the whitewashed clapboard homes of the lighthouse keepers, the first civilian residents on the island. The third and fourth keepers, James Durnan and his son George, maintained the wick lamps and the lighthouse from 1832 to 1905. After 1878 George also rewound - every 48 hours - the new mechanism which revolved the light. Over time, the keepers and their families formed the nucleus of a growing island community. At the end of the 1957 shipping season, the light of the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse was extinguished for the last time by Dedie Dodds, the last of the keepers. After nearly 150 years of service, the stone lighthouse was replaced by the federal Department of Transport with a fully automated, modern skeletal tower. The ownership of the old lighthouse was transferred to Metropolitan Toronto Parks Department in 1958. The Gibraltar Point Lighthouse has since been restored, the remaining homes of the lighthouse keepers demolished, and the surrounding land integrated into Toronto Island Park.",,Marine Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it tells us: This site was previously graced by a spacious Victorian mansion with gabled roofs and porticos. Originally built for the prominent Toronto surgeon Dr. J.F.W. Ross, it was acquired in 1913 by Professor Michael Hambourg, an internationally known piano pedagogue. With his wife Catherine and sons Jan and Boris, he established the Hambourg Conservatory of Music. Its spacious rooms and high ornate ceilings provided an ideal venue for such an institution. On the grand main stairway was a bronze statue of Mercury holding a torch which lit the way to the upper regions. Busts and reproductions of the great composers adorned the studios, and the hallways were festooned with inscribed photos of famous musicians and composers, together with posters, caricatures, concert programs and other memorabilia.Professor Hambourg, who had taught at the Moscow Conservatory, arrived in Canada with his family in 1910. The timing could not have been more propitious, and the idea of a musical institution, based on European concepts, appealed to many of the city's musical elite. Violinist Jan and cellist Boris were already known as brilliant performers, and Michael's oldest brother Mark, one of the world's leading concert pianists and resident in London, England, also lent the aura of his reputation. Michael and his sons were active members of the Arts & Letters Club of Toronto and frequent contributors to the various events.Under the aegis of the Hambourgs, eminent European teachers and performers were attracted to Toronto, and the Conservatory soon became a thriving hub of musical activity. Recognized not only for the excellence of its teachers, it was the alma mater of some of Canada's most noted musicians. On occasion, glittering parties honouring visiting celebrities were held on the premises. After Michael's untimely death in 1915, Boris was appointed Director of the Conservatory and with his wife, Maria, continued the tradition for another 38 years.The Conservatory was also the headquarters of the world famous Hart House String Quartet established in 1924 by the Rt. Hon. Vincent Massey, then Governor-General of Canada. Although the building no longer stands, the Hambourg Conservatory of Music will remain an important landmark in Toronto's musical history.",,Arts,,,Plaque,0.0

Ernest Thompson Seton is one of the most important 19th-Century Toronto novelists.Seton began his career as a scientific illustrator and was a self-trained biologist.From the 1890s until his death he wrote about 60 books, and nearly 400 magazine articles and short stories. His book Wild Animals I Have Known, first published in 1898, has never been out of print. His dramatic wilderness stories brought him praise from such notable contemporaries as Andrew Carnegie, Rudyard Kipling, Theodore Roosevelt, Leo Tolstoy and Mark Twain.It is said that he had an almost mystical reverence for wolves and ‘Indians’ (the word used at the time). He thought that wolves were the most clever and noble of creatures and eventually called himself ‘Black Wolf.’ Indians to him were the finest people because of their understanding of, and respect for, nature.As one of the founders of the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides of America, he inspired children to imitate the Indians’ ways.The message that Ernest Thompson Seton delivered for 60 years was that nature is a great gift and should be valued and protected. One of the more thought-provoking phenomena of the 20th century is the remarkable extent to which we have become a nation of nature lovers.In his time, Ernest Thompson Seton did more than his share to help this cause along.The E.T. Seton Park near the Ontario Science Centre is named in his honour. A plaque was also installed in Lindsay where his family settle after emigrating from England.Hear him talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

Walter Seymour Allward has been referred to as the Dean of Canadian Sculptors, and no doubt, one of the most important of this century. Born in Toronto in 1876, he attended Central Technical School. Mr. Allward then studied under prominent Canadian sculptors William Cruikshank and Emmanuel Hahn, and later in London, England, and Paris, France.Allward first worked or apprenticed as a draftsman for the architectural firm Gibson and Simpson before working at the Don Valley Brickworks where he modelled terra cotta decorative panels.His first commission at 19 years of age was the figure of “Peace” on the North-West Rebellion Monument which is located in Queen’s Park, Toronto (1895). His other early works included the “Old Soldier“, commemorating the War of 1812 in Portland Square, Toronto (1903); and a life-sized figure of Dr. Oronhyatekha (chief ranger) commissioned by the Independent Order of Foresters (1899).Now well established he received commissions to do busts of Lord Tennyson, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir Wilfred Laurier and others. On the grounds of Queen’s Park are statues of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe (1903), Sir Oliver Mowat (1905), John Sandfield Macdonald (1909), and William Lyon Mackenzie (1940).Allward was elected as associate of the Royal Canadian Academy in 1903. His diploma work, “The Storm” (c1920, bronze) is in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.His heroic monuments include the South African War Memorial on University Avenue, the Baldwin-Lafontaine Monument on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and the King Edward VII memorial in Ottawa.Walter Allward’s most important commission was the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, a monument to Canadians killed in the First World War built in Vimy, France (April 1917). Vimy Ridge’s impressive location and vantage point as much as the battle’s significance contributed to its selection. He began to sculpt the figures in clay in a studio in London, England. The clearing of the dangerous 100 hectare site of unexploded bombs, artillery shells, and grenades took two and a half years. It also took two years to find a suitable stone for the memorial. Eventually it was found in a quarry near Sarajevo, Yugoslavia where in 1914, the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife had precipitated the outbreak of the First World War.It took fourteen years and $1.5 million dollars to complete. Designed in the early 1920’s, construction started in 1925 and was completed in 1936Canadian National Vimy MemorialAllward stated in a 1921 interview that his idea for the memorial was inspired by a wartime dream that he had never forgotten: “When things were at their blackest in France, I went to sleep one night after dwelling on all the muck and misery over there, my spirit was like a thing tormented… I dreamed I was in a great battlefield. I saw our men going in by the thousands and being mowed down by the sickles of death… Suffering beyond endurance at the sight, I turned my eyes and found myself looking down on an avenue of poplars. Suddenly through the avenue I saw thousands marching to the aid of our armies. They were the dead. They rose in masses, filed silently by and entered the fight to aid the living. So vivid was this impression, that when I awoke it stayed with me for months. Without the dead we were helpless. So I have tried to show this in this monument to Canada’s fallen, what we owed them and we will forever owe them.”Known as “ Allward of Vimy” Walter Allward’s greatest works have become a vibrant part of our national heritage.Allward appears as himself in the novel The Stone Carvers by Canadian author Jane Urquhart.A few other plaques honour Allward. One was installed in the median on University Avenue near Queen Street. Another is in Brantford at the Bell Memorial Gardens. A plaque has also been installed near his grave in the Saint John’s Anglican (York Mills) Church Cemetery in the northern part of the city.The unveiling and dedication by King Edward VIII of the Canadian National Vimy Monument on July 26, 1836.Hear him talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

Betty Oliphant was born into a prominent family in London, England. Sadly for her, she never knew her father, who died shortly after she was born. She had a passion for dance and fought her middle-class British family for ballet lessons.In the late nineteen twenties and thirties she studied ballet along with stage, tap and ballroom dancing. When she was thirteen years old, she was teaching and dancing professionally, and at seventeen years of age she opened her own school above the Twinings Tea Emporium in London, England. At the age of twenty, she found that she was far too tall for classic dance.During the Second World War she worked as an ambulance driver, as a choreographer of pantomimes, and also for a British Army touring group, “The Blue Pencils”.When the war was over, Betty came to Canada as a war bride with her Canadian husband (a soldier) and her two children. She then opened a school on Sherbourne Street, and helped found the Canadian Dance Teachers Association.Betty Oliphant was the ballet mistress for eight years and later the Associate Artistic Director of the National Ballet of Canada, established by Celia Franca. She was a fabulous teacher but had a reputation as being a very difficult task master. Central to her approach as a ballet teacher was the importance of mastering technique, with the sole purpose of achieving freedom of expression.In 1959 “Miss O,” as she was called, co-founded the National Ballet School with Celia Franca. It was successful beyond their expectations, providing the best dance training and academic schooling combined. Among Miss Oliphant’s early students were, Robert Desrosiers, Karen Kain, James Kudelka, Veronica Tennant, Rex Harrington, and John Aleyne, a choreographer.Betty Oliphant’s legacy is huge. All her work has been an uncompromising quest for excellence and insistence upon the highest standards. She put Canadian Ballet training on the world map and broadened its definition to include the education of the whole person.Awards and HonoursThe National Ballet School’s theatre is called the Betty Oliphant Theatre.Hear her talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

The houses were occupied by industrial workers, industry linked to the railway lines that passed through the neighborhood. All the Garrison Common Cottages on Adelaide St. are gone, but 7 cottages remain on Richmond Street W, and 4 cottages are left on Mitchell Ave. These are now among the oldest modestly scaled residential houses in Toronto. Robinson intended to build a similar group of cottages near the train station in Mimico, but the project collapsed before any were built.

Now:
4 of the cottages on Richmond St. W. are listed. A Demolition Permit has been applied for 2 of the cottages on Mitchell Ave. and 2 more are for sale and being advertised as potential for demolition & rebuild.

In 1953, his family emigrated to Canada and Roger grew up in Montreal. He attended Loyola High School and Loyola College where he met Don Ferguson, co-star and co-founder of the Royal Canadian Air Farce.While in university, Roger developed an obsession for working in radio. He began his broadcasting career in off-air programming and management in a private radio station. He stumbled into comedy in 1970 when comedians John Morgan and Martin Bronstein convinced him to join the cast of the improvisational theatre revue called The Jest Society, (a pun on then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s goal of making Canada a “Just Society”).The cast rapidly underwent changes and, by January 1971, had firmed up with Abbott, Bronstein, Morgan, Don Ferguson and Luba Goy. Dave Broadfoot joined when the show moved to radio in the fall of 1973 and became known as the Royal Canadian Air Farce.  In 1974, Martin Bronstein left the group and, in the late 1980s, Dave Broadfoot stepped aside as well.For several years the Air Farce recorded at the Curtain Club in Richmond Hill, then switched to CBC’s Parliament Street studio in Toronto; it eventually spent many years taping “on the road” in cities and towns across Canada.The weekly broadcast, which was always recorded in front of a live audience, ran for 24 seasons on CBC Radio. Don Ferguson called Roger “the guiding light of Royal Canadian Air Farce.” His talents were many and he possessed a unique combination of artistic, organizational and business skills. And, of course, he was funny!In 1993, the Air Farce made the jump to a weekly television series on CBC and became an instant hit. It ran for 16 seasons and was consistently the highest-rated Canadian comedy series.The troupe also played cross-Canada live tours and recorded several comedy albums.
Some of Roger Abbott’s most famous characters, among the dozens of real-life people he portrayed, were: the Queen Mother, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Leonard Cohen, U.S. President George W. Bush, CBC news anchor Peter Mansbridge, and whoever happened to be Pope. Among his fictitious characters were TV critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me, one half of the Jimmy and Shamus News From Away News Team (with Don Ferguson), First Nations Spokesman “Billy Two Willies” and his beloved sugar-addicted Doughnut Shop regular.Roger has been described as a game changer in the world of Canadian comedy. He especially made the country laugh during the election campaigns. The Farce members were forerunners of political satire in Canada and they made the country laugh for almost four decades.From 1992 to present day, Canadians have celebrated the New Year with the annual Air Farce New Year’s Special on CBC television, which like both radio and TV series, continues to be performed before a live audience.Roger’s favourite charity was Easter Seals Ontario. He was committed to helping children with physical disabilities and was an ardent supporter for more than 30 years. Both Roger and Don Ferguson were jointly honoured as the 2008 recipients of the distinguished Easter Seals Toronto’s Tribute, one that honours excellence for their support of children and youth with physical disabilities. For over 25 years, they hosted the Easter Seals Telethon on CBC television.Abbott co-wrote with Don Ferguson the book Air Farce: 40 Years of Flying by the Seat of Our Pants and it was published in 2011. It’s a memoir full of anecdotes, photographs, scripts, and other memorabilia.Roger loved life, especially his frequent trips to Italy. And he particularly enjoyed his years living on Amelia Street. He was an avid historian of Toronto and could tell many an anecdote about the creation and development of his beloved Cabbagetown neighbourhood.His untimely death in 2011 was a shock to all who knew him personally or as a comedian. In honour of his passing and to mark his contribution to the artistic life of the country, the National Arts Centre in Ottawa flew its flag at half-mast.Shawn Majumder of CBC TV This Hour Has 22 Minutes said that “his impact on Canadian television, radio and comedy in general is so huge, it’s so massive and so rooted in Canadian culture, that his life will be celebrated for a very, very long time.”Awards and Honours",,,,,Plaque,0.0

One of the biggest names in Canadian broadcast journalism is Gordon Sinclair. In 1922 he began working as a reporter for the Toronto Daily Star. He had a series of assignments in the late twenties and thirties that sent him around the world four times as a wandering reporter. He traveled 360,000 miles, through all continents, and on all oceans except the Antarctic. From these adventures he wrote the following four books: Footloose In India, Cannibal Quest, Loose Among the Devils and Khyber Caravan.His career took a turn in 1942 and he began working in radio. He reported on the raid on Dieppe, and he was then asked to write biographical sketches of leaders in that raid. The result was a mid-day personality series – Let’s Be Personal, on Canada’s radio station CFRB which attracted huge audiences, and which continued until the time of his death.At this time, Gordon Sinclair was still working for the newspaper. After 21 years as a newspaperman he quit the Toronto Star and opted for a free-lance career in radio.In 1948, CFRB granted Gordon Sinclair a leave and he took a fifth trip around the world, traveling to Japan, China, Malaya, and on to Europe. He witnessed the takeover of China by the communists.In 1957 he became a charter member of Front Page Challenge, a weekly panel show on the CBC TV network. It was Canada’s longest running television program, which continued until 1995.“Sinc’s” most famous commentary was broadcast in 1973 when anti-American sentiment was at an all-time high. The piece was echoed around the world and is considered one of the most respected tributes from Canada to the people of the United States of America. Its renewed popularity in September 2001 can be attributed to recent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.Hear him talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

His formal training as an artist began in 1884 when he attended evening classes at the Ontario School of Art. After attending school, he apprenticed with the Toronto Lithography Company for five years.Beginning work as a newspaper illustrator and artist, he was with the Toronto Globe from 1889 to 1892 and then served as an illustrator for the New York Herald from 1893-1901. Returning to Toronto, he became a magazine and book illustrator.During World War I he was given an assignment overseas, but was unable to undertake the job. Subsequently, he was commissioned by the Canadian War Records department to paint soldiers who were training at Camp Petawawa and Niagara, Ontario.C.W. Jefferys was also an accomplished painter in the English manner. He produced compelling oils and wonderful watercolours. He especially loved the Saskatchewan prairies and painted at Last Mountain Lake and the Battlefords. His work was widely exhibited and collected. He inspired many artists and was instrumental in forming Canada’s most famous group of landscape painters, the Group of Seven.From 1912 to 1939 he taught painting and drawing in the Department of Architecture at the University of Toronto. He was also a lecturer and part-time instructor at the Ontario College of Art. After his retirement he continued to produce illustrations and murals.Mr. Jefferys and Ivor Lewis were among the group of artists who founded the Graphic Arts Club (later named the Canadian Society of Graphic Arts), which by the 1940’s became the primary artists’ group in Canada.Remembered primarily for his bold illustrations of Canadian history and as a well-known painter of military genre, he is one of the most frequently reproduced of Canadian illustrators, and is best known for his visual reconstructions of Canadian history.C.W. Jefferys was a strong advocate of artistic nationalism, an artist who explored both the nature of our landscape and the historical and pre-historical background that shaped Canadian society.

His conducting teacher was Sir Adrian Boult, and a scholarship allowed him to work with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Charles Groves. From 1975 to 1988, he worked as Chorus Director at the Glyndebourne Festival and then Chorus Director and Resident Conductor at San Francisco Opera before coming to the Canadian Opera Company as Chief Conductor. He was named Artistic Director in 1994 and General Director in 1998, attracting distinguished Canadian artists Robert Lepage and Atom Egoyan as collaborators, and working with authors Margaret Atwood and Robertson Davies to create new operas.“We are a great and rich country and getting richer, but we have third-world investment in the arts,” he said. With determination and resolve, helped by a supportive board and hundreds of others, he embarked on the campaign to build an opera house — he enjoyed describing it as the “Thirty Years’ War.”The architect Jack Diamond said, “Without him we wouldn’t have had an opera house. He was a visionary but had the energy and capability to get it done. He will be remembered as a builder — not just of the building — but of the company itself.” The COC’s recordings and tours earned the company widespread recognition and numerous awards.The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts opened to international acclaim in 2006. To launch its first season, Richard Bradshaw led the COC orchestra and chorus in performing Wagner’s epic The Ring of the Nibelung, becoming the first conductor since Wagner himself to open an opera house with a complete Ring Cycle.The opera house and the more than fifty opera productions he conducted in Toronto are only part of his legacy.

Here's what it says: Beatlemania wasn't quite dead, but it was clearly on the wane. In 1964, on the first North American tour, the Fab Four were greeted by 10,000 fans at the airport in Toronto, and were mobbed at their hotel - where one enterprising teenaged girl even managed to hide in their closet. Their two shows set an attendance record at Maple Leaf Gardens. A year later, when they rolled into town on the heels of their wild and triumphant concert at Shea Stadium, Gardens' owner Harold Ballard turned up the heat, turned off the water fountains, and made a fortune selling soft drinks as the lads from Liverpool again packed the arena for two shows. But by August 17, 1966, something had changed. John Lennon's crack about the band being more popular than Jesus had stirred controversy and protest. Only 800 fans were at the airport to greet the Beatles, and on the day of the shows, tickets were still available. As before, the Beatles only played a dozen songs, and were preceded by several opening acts - which included The Ronettes. Rumours abounded that this would be the band's final tour. ""It would be embarrassing to perform Long Tall Sally when we're 35,"" Paul McCartney said at the pre-concert press conference. ""We can't go on holding hands forever,"" John Lennon added. Writing in the Toronto Star, Arthur Zeldin had it right. He noted that the band didn't play some of their more ambitious recent songs like Eleanor Rigby live, because they couldn't replicate what they did in the studio on stage. Meanwhile, their more subtle numbers - Yesterday was a clear crowd favourite - were all but drowned out by the screaming. ""So, by the very forces of their musical experimentation and development, the Beatles may be taking themselves off the touring, mass live audience scene,"" Zeldin wrote. Maple Leaf Gardens was the only building the Beatles visited on all three of their North American tours, and after that show in 1966, they would play only eight more concerts, and then never do an official live show again. But of course, that was hardly the end of the story.-Stephen Brunt",,Arts,,,Plaque,0.0

The plaque information is courtesy of The Playing With Time Foundation. Here's what the large centre one says: Bruce Mackey was a long-time resident of Degrassi Street. In the 1970s he offered his encouragement and his home to a pair of young filmmakers, Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood. They were making a short children's film and Bruce's home became the set for what would be the very first Degrassi television episode. Bruce's enthusiasm for his diverse and lively neighbourhood was contagious and the early episodes of the Degrassi series prominently featured Degrassi Street homes, the grocery store, the local parks and schools. Linda and Kit embraced the essence of this east end neighbourhood and their work was lauded for its portrayal of real life in downtown Toronto. Bruce's observations of real school life were passed on to the producers and writers and were incorporated into storylines. Using local youngsters, many of Bruce's own students, as actors in the films, the multicultural flavour of the cast became a hallmark of the series. Over the next twenty years, until his untimely death from cancer in 1997, Bruce was a mentor to the filmmaking team. He provided them with ideas for scripts and locales, and he appeared in several episodes as the stern but caring teacher who peered at the Degrassi students over the rims of his glasses. To many of the Degrassi television family, he's fondly remembered as ""The Grandfather of Degrassi"".",,Arts,,,Plaque,0.0

Most doctors heal you when you are sick. Doctor Mustard could foretell your future.A most unconventional man!!Dr. Fraser Mustard, a Canadian physician and scientist, was born in Toronto, Ontario. He attended Whitney Public School and in 1953 he earned a medical degree from the University of Toronto. During his varsity football days he was known as “Moose”.In the 1950s and 60s his heart research focused on blood platelets, arterial disease and, believe it or not, the effects of Aspirin.In 1966 he criticized the Canadian government for their research funding practices. Many medical doctors graduating from Canadian universities were going to the United States due to the lack of research funding. As such, there was a need for many more doctors to graduate in order to maintain the standard of research and Canadian healthcare. It was at this time that he became a founding member of the McMaster University Faculty of Medicine in Hamilton, Ontario. This huge network, built at this time, linked researchers in social health, education, economics and high tech fields like robotics – a model that has been copied all over the world.Dr. Mustard’s interests shifted to early childhood education research where he influenced decision-makers all over the world. His early years’ studies report emphasized the promotion of early child development centres for young children and parents. He recommended that the government boost spending on early education and that programs should be available to all income levels in order to develop healthy, confident children and adults. His message was to convey the incredible importance of a child’s experiences in the first six years of life. Interventions in these early years can set-up a child for life. He said, “These years last a lifetime. The challenge for all societies is to close the gap between what we know about the determinants of early child development and what we do.”Fraser Mustard said, “That’s all education is. It’s just getting the architecture and the function of the brain set.”In 1982 he became the founding president of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) where he spent fourteen years doing research. In 1993 he was awarded the Royal Bank Outstanding Service to Canada award for setting up CIFAR, which is considered one of the best think-tanks and research centres in Canada.Dr. Fraser Mustard has left a legacy. About four months before his death, his followers came to his home to further discuss his works. While working in his living room, the Fraser Mustard Institute for Human Development was designed. The University of Toronto has officially launched the institute.“Fraser Mustard will be remembered as the great renaissance man of Canadian intellectual life. He was an absolute giant, who had a huge impact on his country, and a man of unflagging curiosity and great generosity of spirit”. (University of Toronto former President David Naylor).Dr. Mustard’s findings paved the way to create a province-wide full-day kindergarten program. He will always be remembered for his medical and educational achievements.AwardsA biography of his life written by Marian Packham, entitled J.

Here's what it says: On April 2, 1957, Elvis Presley came to Maple Leaf Gardens, and it's fair to say that Torontonians - at least the older generation - didn't know what hit them. The 22-year-old Presley was just a year removed from the release of his first major label album, and his popularity was skyrocketing. In the past year, he freely acknowledged having earned more than a million dollars. The two shows at Maple Leaf Gardens were played in front of the biggest crowds he had ever entertained, though the earlier set drew just 9,360, nearly 5,000 less than capacity. They also represented the first of only five concerts Presley would perform outside of the United States during his entire career, including two the next night in Ottawa. At the press conferences before his Toronto shows, Presley was relaxed and engaging, sitting cross-legged on a table backstage, while dealing with skeptical journalists and answering a series of largely ridiculous questions. ""He unabashedly admitted he couldn't understand classical music or opera, knows nothing about music and likes the shrieks of the teen-agers,"" the Globe and Mail reported. When Presley finally took the stage, following an opening segment that included a tap dancer, an Irish tenor (who was booed), and a comedian, flashbulbs exploded everywhere and those shrieks all but drowned out the sound coming from the stage. At the first 40-minute show Presley wore his famous gold lame suit in full for the last time. The press made much of Presley's gyrations and the primitive reactions they elicited from the crowd: ""a calculated psychological binge,"" one CBC commentator called it. But members of Presley's entourage remarked later that the Toronto fans were some of the best-behaved they encountered - perhaps because the 90 special police officers on site made any fan who leaped to their feet immediately return to their seat. Afterwards, local jazz musicians predicted that rock and roll was just a passing fad, and critics didn't attempt to hold back their disdain. ""It goes without saying he has the appeal of one-part dynamite and one-part chained-lightning to the adolescent girls; but to one like myself who is neither a girl nor adolescent, I could only feel he was strikingly devoid of talent,"" Hugh Thomson wrote in the Toronto Star.

His writing, ranging from love lyrics to political satire to philosophical meditation, reflects a life committed to humanist ideals. A fearless critic of political oppression, Faludy fled arrest in Hungary in 1938 for his anti-Nazi views, and escaped the Holocaust with an invitation to the United States from President Roosevelt. Returning to Hungary after WWII, he was imprisoned by its Communist regime in Recsk, a brutal concentration camp, from 1950 to 1953. There he and a group of others sustained their spirits with secret night-time lectures on literature and history. Faludy left Hungary for England after the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and there wrote an extraordinary autobiography, My Happy Days In Hell. Internationally esteemed, he moved to Toronto in 1967. From here he continued to write and lecture, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Toronto in 1978. George Faludy lived at 25 St. Mary St. from 1975 until 1989 when he returned to Hungary after the collapse of Communism.

Why Cabbagetown? Probably because of its then (and now) unique and diverse environment.That man was Bill Stapleton, artist, social activist, humanist, free thinker, teacher, decorated citizen, and, for a time, a member of the Communist Party.Some compared his work with the likes of Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec. In their tradition, Bill would hang out at the Winchester Hotel, the long-gone Paramount Tavern and Trojan Coffee House, and sketch the colourful and sometimes rowdy clientele – working-class people having a good time. One might categorize his work as “slice of life” art.Carol Moore-Ede, Stapleton’s friend and curator said of his technique, “[his style] had a relaxed structure but his lines were direct and bold, drawn with rock steady hand and a sharp eye. He painted in startlingly vibrant colours and bold strokes, as forthright in his technique as he was in his social convictions.”Over the years, driven by his artistic and social justice convictions, he travelled to the Soviet Union, Nicaragua, Mexico and Spain to document the human condition.He was associated with ArtHeart, the community-based initiative to assist and promote art and young artists, and a member of “Veterans Against Nuclear Arms.” In an effort to mobilize artists for world disarmament, he joined the movement “Arts for Peace,” where he worked alongside Margaret Lawrence, Pierre Berton, Norman Jewison, Margaret Atwood, and Karen Kain.Collections of Mr. Stapleton’s work are in the National Archives of Canada, and in the Canadian War Museum. In 2006, he donated 1,500 canvases and sketches to the Cabbagetown Regent Park Community Museum in Toronto.In 2007, at the golden age of 91, Mr. Stapleton was presented with the Ontario Federation of Labour’s “Lifetime Cultural Achievement” award for his artistic documentation of labour struggles both in Canada and around the world.So said Bill Stapleton, the man who moved to Cabbagetown to join the human race.",,,,,Plaque,0.0

She eventually divorced her husband and when Allan was 15 she remarried and both children took their stepfather’s last name, which was King.

The plaque was situated at the east end of Carlton Street, near to the top of the stairs going down the park. It was recently damaged and will be replaced in the near future.Charles Sauriol was born in Toronto, Ontario, and was the youngest of seven children. In 1882, his father had moved to Toronto to work as an engineer on the dredging of the Don River.Once in Toronto, the Sauriols lived on Gerrard Street where it intersects with Sumach Street. Charles went to Sacré-Coeur School. As a young boy he camped out in the Don Valley with the 45th East Toronto Troop of the Boy Scouts. It was at this time that he fell in love with the Don Valley, which at the time was woods, some farms, and in its natural state.In 1927, Charles Sauriol purchased his own piece of the Don – a piece of railway land on 40 hectares at the forks of the river. He used it as a cottage. For years he spent his summers there with his family. Only four trees stood on site in 1927. Sauriol began an ambitious project of reforestation, planting shrubs, native hard woods and conifers on the slope surrounding the cottage.As ancestors of his had emigrated to New France from Brittany in 1705, Charles was 8th generation Canadian, and completely bilingual. He spent 30 years working as a marketing director for French publishing houses like Porier Bessette in Montreal. He penned and published a Weekly dedicated to stories of the Don Valley, called Le Samedi.In 1949, Charles Sauriol co-founded the Don Valley Conservation Association. The mission was to preserve the Don Valley as a natural forest. Sauriol organized trips by steam locomotive to raise money. These trips began at the Don River station near Queen Street and attracted up to a thousand passengers, who traveled to such places as Cobourg, Lindsay, and Niagara Falls.In 1954, he joined forces with the Don Valley Conservation Authority. It became the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1957. During the 1950s, the MTCA purchased most of the valleys and ravines that today make up Toronto’s green belt. Much of this was a direct consequence of Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Widespread damage gave new urgency to flood control measures, the MTCA wanted to remove houses from risky floodplain areas.In 1958 plans for the Don Valley Parkway bisected the Sauriol cottage property and they were forced to vacate their beloved cottage. It was demolished the same year.Soon after, in 1966, Charles Sauriol helped establish the Nature Conservancy of Canada. During this period he was its primary fundraiser. He helped the Conservancy acquire parkland across Canada. In Ontario alone, he purchased 500 properties. Over the course of his career, he led fundraising campaigns that netted more than 200 million dollars dedicated to the preservation of green space.Charles Sauriol’s work as an ecologist was well recognized. He was known as “Mr. Conservation.” And in 1989 he received the Order of Canada. He earned 40 other awards and citations. Today four green spaces, a park and a Conservation Areas carry his name.He died of natural causes in 1995 at the age of 91. He truly lived in harmony with nature.“As years go on and the population increases, there will be a need of these lands and more, and in life where so much appears futile, this one thing will remain. In essence, those who continue to support the work of conservation can say, I have lived here, I have done something positive to ensure that its natural beauty and natural values continue.”A Toronto French school and a conservation reserve trail are named after him.Hear him talk:Charles Sauriol in front of the original cottage at the Forks, July 1935.

Dr. Oronhyatekha was a remarkable Canadian who was successful as a Mohawk physician, scholar, and Victorian businessman.Born on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ontario, Oronhyatekha (means “Burning Sky”) was also known by his baptized name of Peter Martin. He attended colleges in Massachusetts and Ohio, before returning to teach at Tyendinaga on the Bay of Quinte.In 1860, Oronhyatekha, on behalf of the Six Nations, gave the welcoming address to the Edward, the Prince of Wales (future Edward VII). He so impressed the Royal Party that he was invited to study in England, resulting in his becoming the first North American of indigenous descent to attend Oxford University. Oronhyatekha’s portrait still hangs in St. Edmunds Hall at Oxford.In 1863 he returned to Canada and married a great-granddaughter of Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea), the great Mohawk chief and Loyalist military leader during the American War of Independence. While attending the University of Toronto, Oronhyatekha joined its militia corps, as well as the Queen’s Own Rifles; he also joined the Masonic order. In 1866 he graduated from the University of Toronto’s medical school, and was likely the first native medical doctor in Canada. He practiced medicine in Frankford, on the Trent River, and in Stratford, Napanee, and London, Ontario.In 1871 Oronhyatekha was part of the first Canadian rifle team invited to compete at Wimbledon, where he won nine prizes.He became President of the Grand Indian Council in 1874, an association of reserves in Quebec and Ontario, and often lobbied for change in legislation to give support to the native peoples in Canada.In 1878 he joined the Independent Order of Foresters (IOF) which was a fraternal life insurance company, and he became the first elected Supreme Chief Ranger of that organization in 1881. He was CEO for twenty-six years. He guided the IOF’s growth from a struggling bankrupt fraternal organization of 400 members to a membership of more than 250,000, and a fund of over eleven million dollars. Dr. Oronhyatekha wrote The History of the Independent Order of Foresters.Bay Street, looking north from Temperance Street (1907).

Gouinlock.  Its opening in 1897 was marked with a parade and a banquet. A life-size sculpture of Oronhyatekha by Walter Seymour Allward was installed in the lobby.  The Temple had been built to last forever but was demolished in 1970 to make way for the Queen-Bay Centre.Oronhyatekha travelled the world extensively, and when he travelled, he collected artifacts. His collection included Australian boomerangs, Indo-Persian battle-axes, Burmese drums, Japanese shoes, and native artifacts, including a silver belt medal and compass owned by Tecumseh, an ally of General Brock. In his collection, as well, were over a thousand specimens of marine shells and coral. In 1911, part of his collection was donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.Oronhyatekha had organized the details of his funeral. His body lay in state at Massey Music Hall in Toronto, and in a four-hour period on March 6th, 1907, over ten thousand people paid their respects. That evening a memorial service was conducted at St. Peter’s Anglican Church, which he had attended. His body was later transported in a specially-commissioned train to Tyendinaga Reserve for a family service at Christ Church and interment there.As one of the greatest builders of the fraternal movement in North America, Dr. Oronhyatekha was widely accepted as a distinguished leader in Canada. His success in Victorian society was founded on the Mohawk values in which he believed, including the principle of reciprocity between people and the institutions they create. While inhabiting two worlds, he remained true to his Mohawk principles, heritage and language.Photo courtesy of the Woodland Cultural CentreHear him talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

The father had a job there and they left him with his mother’s sister in London who, according to Lister, hated kids. She didn’t want him. So he never saw his parents. They’d write to him. I think he was seven before he saw his parents again. But the sister needed money and she was being paid. So she put him in boarding school at St Paul’s Boarding School, which is in London. And I know three people who all went to St. Paul’s School. And all hated it.“He ended up in Vancouver and he met all sorts of people at the university. There was Jon Drainie and Barry Moss and Pierre Berton. A whole host of people (and) all of them ended up coming to Toronto. And then Lister wrote that play We all Hate Toronto, which is quite fun.“Lister was fearless when it came to discussions, talking, words, ideals. I’ve never met anyone who was quite as fearless as he was. But then under duress when he’s attacked, he’s powerless. He doesn’t know what to do. He won’t stand up for himself. So that’s just who he was.“He was reading all the time. And I used to watch him. He’d stand on one leg, with the other one crooked behind the other one. Just standing there reading, anywhere. He was funny. He was always dry, humourous. And other times he quoted poetry. He talked about all sorts of things. Whether it was talking about just water or whatever it happened to be. It was fascinating.“And we travelled South America, San Jose and all kinds of places. And went on cloud forest walks. And saw butterflies and strange, unbelievable things. And saw wonderful architecture that he knew everything about.“During the time when we were in Cabbagetown, we always liked wandering around. And pottering in the shops because you never know what you’re going to find.“Lister was very Scottish in terms of loving Robbie Burns. He wouldn’t call him Robbie. He said, ‘He never got called that. It was Rob Burns. Nobody called him Robbie.’ So that’s what he said. And (he) knew the Burns tartan. And Lister has got his own tartan. And he was very, very strong on ‘You don’t wear tartans if you’re not a Wallace or a Stuart or whatever it is. You should be wearing the right tartan’.”",,,,,Plaque,0.0

(Plaque to be installed in 2017 at 3 Metcalfe Street)Legendary figure skater Toller Cranston was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He spent his young years in Kirkland Lake and, at the age of 11, his family moved to Montréal.At the age of seven, his parents bought him hockey skates. He, in turn, tried to dance on the ice. And so began his love of figure skating. He met Eva Vasak when he was 11 and she coached him for eight years.In 1968, he met Ellen Burka, a renowned skating coach. She invited him to stay in her home for seven days; he ended up staying for seven years. Toller, a clockwise spinner and jumper, brought new artistry to the sport. In no time, he became known for his creative free-skating style, dazzling crowds while accumulating medals.During competitions and championships, it was very clear that Toller was an original: radical in his approach to skating and unlike anything that the public had ever seen. Millions were glued to their televisions to watch his spectacular flamboyant performances.It has been said that the face of men’s figure skating was changed by Toller Cranston and Ellen Burka. Cranston became one of the most sought after choreographers. He inspired future generations of champion skaters who became “tollerized” by wanting to imitate his style.After the 1976 competitive season, Cranston, who always wanted to develop “theatre on ice,” performed and starred in the Broadway show The Ice Show. He then went on to tour Europe with Holiday on Ice.Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, he made a series of skating specials for CBC television. In 1997, he left the skating world to work exclusively on painting and art.Although we know him as a skater, all the while he was also an accomplished painter. Toller’s interest in art began at an early age. His mother was a painter and he too always wanted to paint. He went to the École des beaux-arts de Montréal and, by his third year, it was suggested that the school had little more to teach him. At this point, he turned his attention to becoming a professional artist.Credit: Ottawa CitizenAfter selling his Cabbagetown home in Toronto in the early 1990s, he bought a home in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico where his main focus became painting. In an interview, he said that San Miguel seduced him. He loved the fact that it was so cosmopolitan. He became very involved in the well-being of the local community and a most generous philanthropist.Toller Cranston died in his beloved San Miguel in 2015 at the age of 65.Many paintings, drawings, and objets d’art from the Toller Cranston Estate Collection are being made available through the Artworld Fine Art Gallery in Toronto.Cranston lived a unique yet complex cutting-edge life. He was a colourful character, known for his sense of humour, his energetic manner and his enormous generosity. In 2003, the Globe and Mail wrote that he was “his own work of art.” Critics have said that he will be remembered as larger than life, the figure skating champion who revolutionized the sport and brought colour and panache to the world.Click HERE to see Toller Cranston Remembered – Video Presentation for Memorial (2015)Awards and Honours1976 Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame

Luigi von Kunits was born and raised in the musically-enriched city of Vienna, Austria. He studied violin, composition and music history with some of the finest teachers.When Luigi von Kunits was eleven years old, the great Brahms himself asked him to play second violin in one of the composer’s string quartets. When he was twenty-one, he had the opportunity to perform his own violin concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.In 1893, he traveled to the United States to perform with an Austrian orchestra at the Chicago World’s Fair, where he also won the best solo violinist trophy. At this time, he decided to stay in the United States and taught violin in Chicago from 1893 until 1896. Subsequently, he taught at the Pittsburgh Conservatory from 1896 until 1910 and was also concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.In 1912 he came to Canada and the Canadian Academy of Music in Toronto offered him a position as head violin teacher.In September of 1922, two young men visited Luigi von Kunits in his studio. The proposition Louis Gesensway and Abe Fenboque presented was to found a new symphony orchestra. They had no money or connections and spoke only for themselves and some fine musicians, most of whom were his students. These musicians had a great desire to make better music than they were playing at the vaudeville houses or the “new” movie-houses. They wanted Luigi von Kunits because they knew he could train an orchestra comprised of his students, and that he would be inspired by the challenge of building a new orchestra.On April 23, 1923, at 5:00 pm, the New Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Luigi von Kunits, made its debut in Massey Hall. There were about 60 musicians and admission was 75, 50 and 25 cents, no seats reserved. The response was very good and the critics were most impressed.Mrs. von Kunits initiated the Toronto Symphony Orchestra Women’s Committee. This strong group of women found ways to financially support and sustain the orchestra, and by the fifth season the orchestra had found its place and its patrons. The New Symphony became the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. For the next five years Luigi von Kunits (now an honorary Doctor of Music from the University of Toronto) brought a series of Twilight Concerts to Toronto, which gave purpose and pleasure to its musicians and a great deal of pleasure to its citizens.The 1924 – 25 season included the first orchestra sponsored jointly by the Toronto Board of Education and the Toronto Catholic School Board. This concert was the beginning of the TSO Education Program.In the Fall of 1929, the first radio broadcast was heard across Canada on CNR Radio Network. This performance was broadcast from the Arcadian Court, a large dining area in Simpson’s Department Store in downtown Toronto. The concerts took place on Sundays, which was convenient for the musicians. The venue for broadcasts eventually moved to the studios of CFRB Radio.Maestro von Kunits, with his proper conductor’s mane of hair, always accepted admiration and applause with great style. His life was music. He was devoted to establishing a solid foundation for his orchestra. It has been said that he brought German music to this new land and transmitted it through a mind that was essentially Greek. He acknowledged his doctorate in Latin, yet he was known to keep notes about his students in Greek.When Luigi von Kunits died in 1931, the members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra mourned the loss of their great conductor. For nine years they had played for him, admired him as an artist and loved him as a man.Hear him talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

Ben Wicks was an acclaimed cartoonist with an incredible sense of humour. He was born in London, England in 1926, the son of a poor, working class Cockney family. During wartime the family evacuated to the country. When Ben was 14 years of age they returned to the city and at that time he left school, and he got his first job as a shipping clerk. “I was bloody hopeless at school,” he recalled. “Left at 14 and they were pleased to see me go as I was.”He took evening classes at an art school. “They told me I should take up something else, so I quit. “They were right, I still can’t draw,” he said, years after becoming a highly successful cartoonist.He did learn to play the saxophone in the British Army and toured Europe with a band.In 1957 with just twenty five dollars in his pocket, he and his wife Doreen emigrated to Canada. While in Calgary, he worked as a milkman and then joined the Canadian Army as a musician. It was at this time that he began studying cartooning for books. His first major success was being published by the Saturday Evening Post.In 1963, he visited Toronto and met feature cartoonist Norman Drew who advised him to move to Toronto. Before long he began work at the Toronto Telegram and his cartoon “The Outcasts” was soon syndicated in over 50 newspapers. In 1971 when the Telegram was no longer in operation, his cartoons were picked up by the Toronto Star. Now called “Wicks,” it was carried by 84 Canadian and more than 100 American newspapers.“Ben Wicks’ cartoons provide important insights on 20th century events and Canadian culture. His work features keen insights into the human condition and a sense of humour that add depth and texture to our understanding of historical events, particularly during the Trudeau era. The cartoons will be particularly useful for research into Canadian studies, political science and communications, says Michael Moir, University archivist and Head of the Clara Thomas Archives & Special Collections.“I had admired the single-panel Ben Wicks cartoons for years”, his friend and standup comic Dave Broadfoot said. “Those cartoons worked like what is called a “blackout’ on stage – a comic idea that lasts 30 seconds with one strong, self-explanatory punch line. Not easy to do. That’s what Ben’s cartoons were: funny, political and brief.”In 1980, he opened a restaurant on Parliament Street in Cabbagetown called The Ben Wicks. He sold it just three years later, after losing his shirt. He was apparently a clever creative man but a very poor administrator. The restaurant kept his name for a while, then became The Local Gest. It is now called The Tilted Dog.Ben Wicks was also a TV personality and on his own show, The World of Wicks, he interviewed personalities such as Michael Caine, Ingrid Bergman and Sir Edmund Hilary.He also wrote and illustrated books, and established the I.Can Foundation, which provided education and literacy programs, such as Born to Read, for children.Hear him talk:",,,,,Plaque,0.0

He was not athletic, he read a lot, was smart in school, and skipped some grades. After some difficulty in a regular classroom, his mother took him for an IQ test. His score was extremely high. He was then transferred to the Model School at Church and Gould Streets (now Ryerson University) where Toronto’s “gifted” children went in the 1930s. Arthur also excelled in Boy Scouts, reaching the highest rank – King’s Scout.As a youngster, he read everything he could find on, things scientific, electrical, mechanical or astronomical. His intent was to study radio engineering, but at that point in the 1930’s, the economic depression was at its height. Very few families could afford to send their children to university, and there were no scholarships in engineering. His sister, Rosemary, scored excellent marks in Grade 13, but didn’t get a scholarship to the University of Toronto, so she voluntarily repeated the year in order to earn marks high enough to win the $125 tuition to Victoria College to study English literature. In 1937, at the age of sixteen, Arthur joined his sister there. His scholarship was for mathematics and physics, and it was physics that he pursued, earning a Ph.D from the University in 1949. While at University, Arthur was very involved in the Toronto amateur jazz scene and played clarinet with a group called the Delta Jazz Band. Listening to traditional jazz from his large record collection continued to stimulate and interest him throughout his life.While on a postdoctoral fellowship to Columbia University, he met Charles H. Townes, a leader in research on microwave spectroscopy, and their long collaboration began. In 1951, he married Aurelia, Charles Townes’ youngest sister.Over the ten years that followed, Arthur Schawlow worked as a physicist at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and with his brother-in-law in his spare time. They co-authored a book, published in 1955, entitled Microwave Spectroscopy, and continued to work together on the principles of a device – the Laser.Arthur Schawlow then went on to become a professor of physics at Stanford University, and was chairman of the department of physics from 1966 to 1970.

But you may have come across him on walks through the Cabbagetown neighbourhood without knowing it.But, in art circles, he was well known. His work appears in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian War Museum and in many private collections.Born in Montreal, and as many artists, he was largely self- taught. In his early years in Montreal, he worked with Fredrick Varley and Louis Muhlstock.During the summer in the early 1940’s, he worked as a deckhand on cargo boats plying the Great Lakes.Word War II drew him to enlist in the Merchant Navy in 1943. Shortly thereafter, the National Gallery of Canada, realizing his talent, commissioned him to produce drawings of shipboard life.Jack Nichols’ big break came when the Royal Canadian Reserve appointed him “official war artist,” and this gave him the rank of Lieutenant, and put him to work on a number of Canadian warships.He witnessed the D-Day landing, the destruction of a German warship convoy and other horrific acts of war.Out of this came some of his best known works; Men on the H.M.C.S., Iroquois, Actions on His Majesty’s Canadian Ship, Drowning Sailor, Taking Survivors on Board, and many others. These artistic depictions of Canadian bravery in battle did not go unnoticed.In 1947 he was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, which, at last, gave him the means to formally study fine lithography, printmaking and to paint in the United States.In 1948 Jack Nichols went on to teach at the Vancouver School of Art. Shortly thereafter he went on to be a prizewinner at the Second International Exhibition of Drawing and Engraving in Lugano, Switzerland, and then on to display at the Venice Biennale. He has had exhibitions at the Ellen Gallery and the McCord Museum in Montreal, the MacKenzie Gallery in Saskatchewan, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Canadian War Records Collection in Ottawa and in Canada’s most prestigious venue, the Canadian War Museum, etc.His friends talk of his intensity and his charm. They have described Jack Nichols as prodigiously talented, a painter who Goya himself might have envied.Jack Nichols never advertised his accomplishments.

Josef Škvorecký was a very human hero who loved the freedom he had as a writer in Canada.Born in Nachod, Czechoslovakia, Mr. Škvorecký was educated at a local school and was intent on learning English because he was a great fan of the American singer/actor, Judy Garland.During the 1950’s he worked as an editor, translator and teacher.He attended Charles University in Prague and in 1952 completed a Phd in philosophy. While working for a government publishing company, he translated the works of Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and Raymond Chandler from English to Czech.At this time he wrote several novels including his first novel The Cowards and The End of the Nylon Age. They were banned after publication but have now been translated into 20 languages.Although he loved his homeland, after the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, Mr. Škvorecký and his actress/novelist wife Zdena Salivarova came to Toronto.He began working as a writer- in-residence at the University of Toronto, and then in 1971 he taught literature and film until 1990. He also wrote for television and radio, and wrote screenplays for film.Also in 1971 he and his wife founded a publishing company called 68 Publishers which published banned Czech and Slovak books. These books, written by such people as Vaclav Havel, Ludvik Vaculik and Milan Kundera, were smuggled into communist Eastern Europe. For providing this critical literary outlet, the president of post-communist Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, later awarded the couple the Order of the White Lion in 1990 during their first visit back to Czechoslovakia.Josef Škvorecký was a brilliant storyteller who wrote more than 40 books. In Canada, he is considered to be a Canadian author despite the fact that he wrote mostly in Czech.“I am a Czech and I am a loyal citizen of Canada,” he told an interviewer in 2006.“Canada is the country where, for the first time in my adult life, I found freedom, including the freedom to be a Czech and at the same time a Canadian.”The miracle of jazz, the expatriate experience, repression and the horrors of totalitarianism are the themes of his fictitious novels.He once declared: “To me literature is forever blowing a horn, singing about youth when youth is irretrievably gone, singing about your homeland when, in the schizophrenia of the times, you find yourself in a land that lies over the ocean, a land – no matter how hospitable and friendly – where your heart is not, because you landed on those shores too late.” He and his wife visited their homeland often, but never wished to return permanently.In a most humble way he thanked Canada for his freedom. “There is beauty everywhere on earth, but there is more beauty in those places where one feels that sense of ease which comes from no longer having to put off one’s dreams.”He is buried in Cabbagetown’s Necropolis, just beside the chapel.Awards and Honours",,,,,Plaque,0.0

He designed several churches, among them the church of St. Cyprian in Seaton village, St. John the Evangelist on Portland Street and the church of St. Thomas on Huron Street.After 1888, domestic architecture monopolized his prolific output. He designed 11 houses in Wychwood Park and others in Rosedale, The Annex and Forest Hill, many of which embodied the contemporary design principles found in the Arts and Crafts Movement, of which Smith was a leading exponent. His style was called English Cottage, which had steep-pitched roofs, tall chimneys, and bands of small-paned casement windows.In his 33 years of practice he designed over 2,500 houses in the city. He was also on-site and supervised the construction.Another outstanding achievement was the design of the co-op housing complex at the corner of Spruce and Sumach Streets in Cabbagetown. It was begun in 1913 and flourishes to this day as a model of successful co-operative housing.Mr. Smith was also one of the founding members of the Arts and Letters Club.Eden Smith died on October 10, 1949, and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Guelph, Ontario.Hear him talk:Spruce Court Co-op (at Spruce and Sumach) designed by Eden Smith",,,,,Plaque,0.0

Raised by his strict Jamaican grandmother, he had a strong sense of right and wrong.In February 1996, Ainsworth Dyer enrolled with the Militias 48th Highlanders of Canada as an infantryman. In October 1997, he transferred to the Regular Force. When completing battle-school he became a member of the Edmonton-based battalion of the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry. After joining the 5 Platoon in 1998, he quickly developed into a mature and responsible soldier. He served as a Rifleman and was deployed on Operation Palladium to Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2000.Always looking to challenge himself, Ainsworth trained for the “Mountain Man” competition, the blood and guts of the light infantry soldier. He also conquered the skies and became a paratrooper. His sense of adventure complemented his strong temperament.Corporal Dyer was one of four Canadians killed during a “friendly fire” incident in Afghanistan in 2002. Eight other soldiers from the Battalion were injured. This tragedy is referred to as The Tarnak Farm Incident. An American F-16 fighter jet piloted by an Air National Guard dropped a laser-guided bomb on the Canadians who were conducting a night firing exercise at Tarnak Farms. The deaths of these Canadian soldiers were Canada’s first during the war in Afghanistan and the first in a combat zone since the Korean War.Corporal Ainsworth Dyer was buried with full military honours in the Necropolis Cemetery in Cabbagetown.

It was at this spot that Ainsworth proposed to his girlfriend Jocelyn Von Sloten before he left for Afghanistan. After Ainsworth was killed, Aart Von Sloten, Jocelyn’s father, began making wooden crosses for all the soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Each cross is inscribed with the name and rank of the 158 men and women who died while serving in the Canadian forces in Afghanistan. Over the years, a ceremony has been held on Remembrance Day and the names of those who have died are read aloud and a cross placed in the ground in their honour. The ceremony began with a small group but has grown to include many people who wish to pay their respects to these fallen soldiers.Ainsworth Dyer is described by his colleagues as a thoughtful leader, his own man, and one who had strength of heart that was unparalleled.

His legacy, however, remains a major architectural accomplishment. Revell's design was viewed by many as representing a break with tradition. Former Mayor Phil Givens claimed that ""new City Hall has provided staid old Toronto with the impetus and architectural inspiration with which to proceed."" Indeed, despite the considerable controversy and debate among architectural traditionalists, this award-winning design represented a step forward in time and was repeatedly described as ""monumental"" and ""expressionistically modern.""Revell's design was the result of an international competition held in 1956 when the original design for City hall - done by a coalition of firms noted for substantial institutional buildings of refined materials but conservative form - was decried as  ""dull and uninteresting"" and ""an inhuman pile of stones"" by architectural students at the University of Toronto. Coverage in the student newspaper, The Varsity, was picked up by Toronto dailies and undoubtedly influenced the Toronto plebiscite in which the proposal was defeated. A new, year-long architectural competition drew 520 entries from 42 countries.Born in 1910 at Vaasa, a town on the west coast of Finland, Viljo Revell studied architecture at the Institute of Technology in Helsinki and opened his practice there in 1935. He also served as assistant to the renowned Finnish architect Alvar Aalto and though he always remained a loyal admirer of Aalto, Revell led the modern nationalist school that developed in Finland after World War II.Decades after the opening of City Hall on September 13, 1965, the building remains a symbol of modern Toronto.

Keefer, were engaged to design a new supply system.One of the recommended facilities was a reservoir on Rose Hill, north of the City, which would provide an improved distribution pressure and would supersede existing reservoirs at lower elevations.A contract for construction of the 152 million L capacity reservoir was awarded to Messrs. R. Mitchell & Co. in October, 1873, for a price of $73,800.00. Construction commenced in late October, 1873, and the reservoir was completed and placed in service by December, 1874, connected to the distribution system by a 61 cm pumping main from John Street Pumping Station, about 8 km away.By 1963, the open reservoir was surrounded by City development and, to protect the water quality and fill a need for added capacity, Metropolitan Toronto decided to deepen, enlarge, and cover it at a cost of $3.4 million. To preserve for the citizens of the area, enjoyment of a body of water in the heart of the City, surface features were added, consisting of a fountain, fountain pool, four acres of reflecting ponds, and a cascade waterfall.

Here's what the plaques say: When archaeologists in the late 19th century documented remains of Aboriginal occupation on Baby Point (just across the river), they also noted remnants of a settlement on this side of the Humber. The occupants of this site may have been Mississaugas, an Anishinaubeg people and ancestors of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation. In the 1690s, the Mississaugas had moved from the north shore of Lake Huron to their new home in southern Ontario, displacing in the process the Iroquois who inhabited the region and who had built Teiaiagon on Baby Point. The Mississaugas established settlements along the north shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.  Their village here, at the mouth of the Humber River, was on one of the important trade and communications routes linking Lake Ontario to Georgian Bay and the upper Great Lakes.Like other nations before them, the Mississaugas negotiated to their best advantage with the French and British governments who were competing to profit from this area. In August 1759, a few days after the British defeated the French for control of Lake Ontario, Tequakareigh, a leader from the Mississaugas village near the mouth of the Humber, negotiated peace with the British at Fort Niagara on the Niagara River.The British eventually purchased from the Mississaugas much of the land now occupied by the City of Toronto - although some of the terms of that purchase were only finally settled in 2010. The Mississaugas continued to live in this area during the early years of the new Town of York, but then moved west in 1826 to settle at a mission under the leadership of Kahkewaquonaby (Reverend Peter Jones), near the mouth of the Credit River.  In the 1840s, the Mississaugas were again under pressure to relocate. They accepted an offer from the Six Nations of the Grand River to settle on their reserve near Brantford, Ontario, where they have resided since 1847.",,First Nations,,,Plaque,0.0

Aboriginal peoples likely used this advantageous site for thousands of years, but between circa 1670 and 1688, a Five Nations Iroquois Seneca village was located here.  Its inhabitants called it ""Teiaiagon"". An agricultural village of perhaps 1,000 people, it would have been surrounded by fields of corn, beans, and squash.The Five Nations Iroquois established this and other communities along the north shore of Lake Ontario following their victory over the Huron-Wendat circa 1650. The strategic location of Teiaiagon remains obvious today. It was defended by the steep banks of the point, allowing its occupants to control the southern end of the Carrying Place trail, an important trade route linking Lake Ontario to the upper Great Lakes through Lake Simcoe.We know of this village in part from Europeans who visited it. Father Louis Hennepin and 15 companions found refuge here in 1678 when their ship sought shelter from a storm. In 1680, the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle recorded his stay at Teiaiagon while on his way north. The village was abandoned by the Seneca when they returned to their traditional homeland in what is now New York State. Later, the Mississaugas may have occupied the site as well.

At the time the fire hall was built, the newly-established force consisted of five full-time fire-fighters, two pumper trucks and several volunteers. As North York developed and its population grew, the fire-fighting force expanded and the fire hall was enlarged with an additional bay on its left-side circa 1952, presumably by Brown. Architecturally, the fire-hall was fashioned in the Colonial Revival style incorporating clean lines, contemporary materials and an overall massing influenced by Modern design. Its tower features a gabled roof with cornice returns, pilasters framing a half-circle louvered vent, time clocks, red brick quoins and frieze-like bands of smooth-cut Indiana limestone.

In 1946, the municipal hall was enlarged with an addition, incorporating a stylized round-arched entrance with limestone detailing at its east side. Stylistically, Murray Brown based the first municipal hall on North American colonial architecture, incorporating the imagery of civic authority and a design that was considered appropriate to a small municipal government. Brown was also responsible for the design of the municipality's official crest bearing the inscription ""Progress with Economy"". In 1942, he was commissioned by the municipality to design North York's first fire hall, whose fire hose tower has also been reconstructed in the adjacent public park. In 1953, the first municipal hall housed the Magistrate's Court. During the late 1960's, the building was operated by the Emergency Measures Organization and the council chamber served as a courtroom where construction safety law offences were tried. The municipal hall was later used by North York's Parks and Recreation Department until May 1, 1978. Subsequently, the Victorian Order of Nurses took possession of the premises.

The second plant was a 182 000 cubic metre per day slow sand filtration plant constructed from 1909 to 1911. This plant continued in service until 1968 and was maintained ready for operation until 1975. Currently, two of its filter basins are used for lagooning filter backwash wastes. The third plant, a Ver Mehr mechanical drifting sand filter plant with a capacity of 273 000 cubic metres per day, was constructed during the First World War and went into service in December, 1917. This plant continued in use for 60 years and was kept ready for operation until 1981. The present plant, a modern, high rate, direct filtration plant, was constructed from 1975 to 1977 and placed in service in April, 1977. It was designed to supply 273 000 cubic metres per day with a design filter rate of 11.7 cubic metres per hour, but included hydraulic spaces for high rating to double that capacity. The plant has been successfully operated at a capacity of 409 000 cubic metres per day. This resulted in decommissioning of the drifting sand plant in 1981 and establishment of a 409 000 cubic metre per day nominal capacity. In 1966 the Island plant was changed from a year-round operation to summer only peak control and operates from about May 1 to October 1 each year.",,Government Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

The original plant, designed by engineer Allen Hazen and completed in 1912, was the first water purification facility in the City of Toronto. From 1914 to 1917, a larger plant was built to replace it. Both facilities played a critical role in the reduction of waterborne diseases, including typhoid fever, that killed hundreds of people in the 1880s and 1890s. The filtration plant was guarded during both World Wars to prevent possible sabotage of the city's water supply.The original plant filtered lake water through layers of sand and gravel before piping it to the city through a tunnel under the Toronto harbour. A few of the 1917 buildings are still in use as part of the present water treatment facility, which was built from 1975 to 1977.

Thousands of people, many of them local residents or streetcar commuters, worked here making a vast array of products, including candy, toys, clothing, furniture, pianos, and rubber goods. This land was occupied by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years, and the marshes to the south were still a notable hunting and fishing territory at the time of colonization. In the 19th century, as the settlement grew, the land was used for brick making and by market gardeners to grow produce for sale in the city. The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) was laid down through the area in the 1850s.In 1906 the makers of Chiclets gum built the first major factory in this area, and others soon followed. The GTR installed freight tracks in 1907, connecting the plant sites to the rail network. Electrical, sewage, and other infrastructure was built to serve the neighbourhood.During the world wars, significantly more women entered the workforce, replacing men serving in the armed forces. The factories also supported the war effort by making items such as bullet tips and military clothing.Starting in the 1960s, as manufacturing declined across North America, factories on Carlaw began to close or move to the suburbs near highways. Many former industrial buildings in this area were altered for small businesses or residences.

Here's what they say: Once one of the city's largest centres of charity, the House of Providence stood nearby for over 100 years. It was initiated by Toronto's Roman Catholic Bishop, Armand-François-Marie de Charbonnel, in response to the plight of the desperately poor, including many Irish immigrants. To provide shelter and food for those most in need, de Charbonnel enlisted both the help of the Sisters of St. Joseph and the generosity of the surrounding community. Operated by the Sisters, the House of Providence opened in 1857. Nearly always filled to capacity, the House of Providence would eventually quadruple in size to provide for about 700 residents, including the elderly, the unemployed, orphans, widows, and newcomers to Canada. Some stayed only a few days; others, for years. At its doors, daily meals were given out to the hungry, particularly during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The House of Providence was demolished in 1962 to make way for the Richmond Street exit from the Don Valley Parkway. It was by then a home for the aged, and its residents moved with the sisters of St. Joseph to Providence Villa and Hospital, a new facility located at St. Clair and Warden Avenues, and known today as Providence Healthcare.",,Institutional Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

It was established in 1793 by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe hope to attract settlers to York from England and the United States. He offered 81 ha land grants to those who agreed to take an oath of loyalty to the King of England. These lots extended from Lot Street (now Queen) north to Bloor, and from the Don River to the Humber River.This site includes some of the property that Simcoe granted to his own estate manager, John Scadding, in 1796. Scadding built three houses on the land over the years. One of these - the oldest surviving house in Toronto - was moved in 1879 to the Canadian National Exhibition grounds, where it remains today.After Scadding's death in 1824, the family kept the property here and purchased more adjoining land. In 1856, the Town of York became the rapidly growing City of Toronto. City Council, in need of land to build a new hospice and jail, allocated £14,000 to buy about 50 ha of the Scadding land.Plans begin right away for the House of Refuge, a hospice for the ""poor, needy, and disabled,"" and the Toronto (Don) jail, a progressive ""reform"" jail.

Here's what this plaque says: These patient-built walls are a testament to the abilities of the people whose unpaid labour was central to the operation of asylums in the Province of Ontario during the 19th and 20th centuries. The asylum on Queen Street first opened in 1850 and was overcrowded within a few years. The initial idea of work as therapy gave way to the reality of work intended to save the provincial government money through unpaid patient labour. Men worked outdoors on construction, maintenance and farm work, including building and repairing many of the structures behind which they were confined, including the still-existing boundary walls on the south side of this property, built in 1860, and the east and west boundary walls built in 1888-89. Women worked primarily inside, doing the sewing, knitting and laundry for the asylum, while also working as domestic servants in both the nurses' and doctors' residences not far from this spot. Both men and women also worked in their own sex-segregated wards doing domestic chores such as cleaning, washing and scrubbing floors. Patients also worked in the male (west side) and female (east side) infirmaries, where they helped to care for those of their fellow patients who were sick and dying. Seen by many as the physical representation of prejudiced attitudes towards people with a psychiatric diagnosis, the walls which still stand today are historical monuments to the exploited labour of all psychiatric patients who lived, worked and died on these grounds since 1850.Presented by the Psychiatric Survivor Archives of Toronto, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Friends of the CAMH Archives, and many other donors.

The market expanded south of Front Street in 1844 with the construction of the Market House and City Hall. It was enlarged again in 1851 when the St. Lawrence Hall and Market was built north of Front Street. The market was an important source of revenue and the City of Toronto rebuilt the north and south market buildings in 1899.

It became known as ""King's Mill"". Poorly managed and badly maintained, the first King's Mill burned in 1803. Other water-powered sawmills and gristmills (for grinding grains into flour) followed on this site. The last and grandest of them all was constructed circa 1848 as a key part of merchant William Gamble's expanding milling enterprise.Burned in 1881, its stone ruins would become one of Toronto's most romantic landmarks, known as ""the Old Mill"" and a rare visible reminder in the late-20th century of the days of water power.

Through the sale of $5.00 stock certificates, the Association purchased the houses at 344 and 346 Spadina Avenue in 1924, adding meeting rooms in 1929.The Labor Lyceum operated as the headquarters for the non-Communist trade unions of the primarily Jewish garment district. The seasonal nature of the textile industry meant that workers could socialize and strategize here during slow work periods. The Labor Lyceum also served as an important cultural centre for various Jewish societies and fraternal organizations. It hosted a range of activities from lectures and rallies to dances, plays, and concerts. In the 1940s, the provincial Co-operative Commonwealth Federation held political conventions here.Beginning in the 1950s, the Jewish community moved out of the Spadina Avenue area. The Labor Lyceum, however, remained significant to new immigrant groups and their labour activism.

Here's what it says: For more than 130 years, this section of the Don Valley was home to a succession of important paper-making facilities. The first mill to operate here was built in 1858 by John Taylor & Brothers and known as the Middle Mill. It was powered by water from the Don River that was fed into a fast-flowing, man-made channel called a millrace.Operating night and day except on Sundays, the Middle Mill and two other mills nearby, also owned by the Taylors, produced a substantial amount of printing paper. Prominent newspapers, such as The Globe, were printed on paper made from rags and straw at the Taylor mills. The mills also manufactured paper stock for products such as posters, books, and tea filters.In 1907, Robert Davies purchased the Middle Mill and founded the Don Valley Paper Company. Howard Smith Paper Mills took over in 1939, becoming a subsidiary of the Dominion Tar and Chemical Company (later Domtar) in 1961. Due to falling demand, the paper plant closed in 1989.The City of Toronto and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority demolished most of Domtar's factory in 1992, and carried out an extensive clean-up of the land, returning it to its natural state by planting native trees and shrubs.

Traffic on St. Clair Ave. was sometimes disrupted for five to ten minutes at a time as livestock were lead by a Judas cow or goat from the stockyards across the street to the packinghouses.Working in a packinghouse was not easy. The kill floor, where carcasses were dressed out after slaughter, was a male domain in which each worker had a precisely delineated task in the physically strenuous process of disassembly. Female employees worked on packing lines for processed meats, such as sausages and bacon, but they too faced heavy lifting, harsh work environments and a fifty-six hour work week until 1942.In 1944, the Government of Ontario purchased the Union Stock Yards from American interests and renamed it the Ontario Stock Yards.

Until 1945, the majority of livestock sold at the Ontario Stock Yards were transported by rail and while most were slaughtered in the Junction area, some were also shipped out by rail to national and international markets. This attracted meatpacking companies, including Gunns, Swift Canadian, the Harris Abattoir and a variety of industry-related businesses to agglomerate in the vicinity. Rail became an important feature in the urban landscape, as it provided employment, connected distant markets, stimulated engineering and local economy. However, the preference of rail shifted to trucks and highways during the 1950-60s.

The Carrie doll and the Reely Ride-em Tractor were among the company's popular products at this time. Reliable was also a leader in plastics technology. During the Second World War, the company made plastic bullet tips, bayonet covers, and oil containers for the armed forces.

Here's what it says: The area behind the Don Jail was once divided into three exercise yards for inmates. In this 1956 photograph, the exercise yards are behind the brick wall on the right.Before penal reform in the 19th century, people believed that prisons were only for punishment. Many prisons placed inmates in overcrowded cells and rarely let them outdoors. Penal reformers maintained that incarceration was not just an instrument of punishment, but also a chance to prepare convicts for going back into society. They believed that inmates should lead balanced lives that included fresh air, work, and education.Overlooking the Don River Valley and surrounded by fields and woodland, the location of the Don Jail was considered to be a healthy moral and physical environment for inmates. The property included a hospital, residences, and a farm. The farm grew oats, potatoes, carrots, and peas. The inmates raised chickens, turkeys, sheep, and pigs. Researchers have found signs of an old well and cistern, which would have been used to supply the jail with water. A large skylight and rotunda brought sunlight into the centre of the building and reduced the need for artificial light. The original skylight was removed around 1960. The present skylight is a reconstruction based on the 1956 photograph displayed here.Allowing inmates out of doors meant there was a risk of escape attempts. The so-called Polka Dot Gang once overpowered two guards and formed a human pyramid to try to mount the yard wall. More security soon arrived and defeated the attempt.  A guard room was eventually installed to monitor inmates through slim, horizontal rifle windows. These windows are on the ground floor of the west tower.Although the Don Jail was progressive in some respects, part of its role was to carry out the death penalty. In 2007, archaeologists found that 15 people were executed and buried in the east exercise yard. After the archaeologists studied and documented the area, the human remains were re-interred in St. James Cemetery, Toronto. The area where the graves were is outlined in paving stone.",,Institutional Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what they say: Surrounded by farmland until the 1940s, this stretch of Eglinton Avenue, from Pharmacy Avenue to Birchmount Road, became famous in the 1950s as Scarborough's ""Golden Mile of Industry"" - a hub of large-scale manufacturing and a celebrated symbol of post-war prosperity. The area's transformation began during World War II, when the government of Canada acquired a vast tract of farmland for a munitions plant known as GECo (General Engineering Company). After the war, the Township of Scarborough purchased the plant and additional surrounding land for proposed development. Some of the munitions plant buildings became municipal offices, a Council Chamber, and a public library branch, while other buildings were leased or sold to small businesses.In 1950, ball bearings giant Svenska Kullagerfabriken (SKF) acquired part of the GECo lands and the industrial boom of the Golden Mile began.The Golden Mile promised inexpensive land and low property taxes to industries growing with Canada's post-World War II economic boom. By 1955, corporations such as Frigidaire, the John Inglis Company, Thermos, and Warner Lambert had major manufacturing facilities here. Automobile makers and dealers joined them, including Volkswagen, Rootes Motors, and as late as 1974, a General Motors van plant. Their move to this area provided much needed industrial property taxes, and served as a catalyst for further development. Residential subdivisions sprang up to house the Golden Mile's workforce, followed by strip plazas, which were then celebrated as modern conveniences. By the 1980s, larger industries were moving to less expensive properties, and the Golden Mile of Industry gradually became the Golden Mile of Commerce - known for its large retail stores and car dealerships. However, some industrial buildings do survive - along with street names such as Thermos Road - to remind us of an earlier Golden Mile.",,Industrial Buildings,,,Plaque,0.0

Castle Frank Brook (later known as Severn Creek and since buried) was the source of water for Severn's brewery.In the late 19th century, brewing practices improved, and expanded transportation systems allowed breweries to serve a greater area. Although Severn installed a 15-horsepower steam engine to advance his brewery, ultimately his small operation was unable to compete with the region's larger breweries.John Severn died in 1880 and his son, George, inherited the company.

Here's what the plaques say: In the late 1800s, Aboriginal artifacts, perhaps Huron-Wendat in origin, were found up on the edge of the valley, not far from here. The Huron-Wendat lived for centuries along the waterways flowing into Lake Ontario, including along the Humber River.  The remnants of their villages have often been identified by their distinctive ceramic vessels, tobacco pipes, stone axes, and bone tools, dating to between 1200 and 1580. The Huron-Wendat then moved north to land between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay (still known today as Huronia) to consolidate their communities into a confederacy.  The Huron-Wendat were accomplished traders with extensive networks throughout northeastern North America and beyond. They made contact with the French in 1609, and welcomed the first of many French visitors, Étienne Brûlé, to southern Ontario in 1610.  Approaching a Huron-Wendat village, French travellers encountered well-tended fields of corn, beans, and squash. Agriculture, supplemented by fishing, gathering, and hunting, allowed some Huron-Wendat villages to grow to nearly 2,000 people. Surrounded by fields and situated near rivers or creeks, villages of longhouses were positioned to command a view over the surrounding territory, and were sometimes surrounded by a palisade to protect their inhabitants.Huron-Wendat use of the Carrying Place trail along the Humber River likely became occasional after 1600, as this route was threatened by their enemies, the Five Nations Iroquois. Displaced from their homeland by 1650, many Huron-Wendat moved to the Quebec City area where they remain today. While urban development has since destroyed many of their former village sites on the Humber, traces of these settlements may still be found in the yards and gardens that border the river.",,First Nations,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: The War of 1812 between the United States and Britain, fought partly on Canadian soil and lasting until 1814, is seen today not so much as a war that Britain and Canada won, but as a war where everybody lost. A few people, however, have emerged as legends and are now part of Canadian folklore, like Tecumseh, Isaac Brock, and Laura Secord (and her cow). But for the most part, the War of 1812 was a bloody excess of destruction. By the time the United States had its sights set on York, the British had already seen the death of General Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights the year before. York, however, wasn't strategically important, unlike the towns that bordered the States along the Niagara River. But York was the capital of Upper Canada, after all, and had in its possession a huge stash of weapons, gunpowder, and a massive yet unfinished warship, The Isaac Brock, in the harbour. It was understood whoever held that ship, the biggest ever built, would control the Great Lakes. In 1813, the Town of York had a population of about 600 centered in and around King, Berkeley and Front Streets. It was there that the first Legislative Buildings once stood. At the other end of town was the Garrison at Fort York, still standing, in part, near the grounds of the CNE. In between the town and the Fort were a few farms and the harbour. Back then, the only entrance to the harbour was through its western gap. It wasn't until 1858 that the eastern gap was created when a huge storm carved its way through the peninsula that, until then, curved out into Lake Ontario, thus creating the Toronto Islands. On the morning of April 27, 1813, the tall ships of the U.S. Fleet could be seen entering the harbour: fourteen immense warships with 1700 green uniformed soldiers aboard, sailing past Gibraltar's Point on Toronto Island, hell-bent on attacking not only York, but its very way of life. The war that was being fought miles away was finally coming to town. If you were Loyalist and fled to Canada from the United States, you were here because you didn't want to live in a Democracy, you liked the King of England and his way of governing. None of this 'by the people, for the people' stuff for you. Such was the feeling of many who lived in York: to remain English and never surrender to the Republic that wanted Britain out of the New World forever. This mighty ideal held true to the man who was to become the single most powerful figure in 19th century Toronto, especially after his valiant and widely seen heroic efforts during the capture of York, John Strachan. The winds carried the American fleet, under the command of 34-year-old General Pike, past the Garrison, and made land at the present-day Sunnyside Beach. The soldiers jumped out and waded onto the beach while the two main ships, The President Madison and Oneida, fired their cannons on York. The Battle of York was underway. Three hundred British soldiers, 200 Ojibwa warriors and 300 untrained men and boys of York met the Americans. The Battle of York was to become a blood-soaked disaster for both sides. So, as the Americans advanced on Fort York, British General Sheaffe, in retreat, gave the orders to blow up the ammunition magazine. Seconds later, with the Americans only 366 m away, 227 kg of gunpowder blew sky high. Twenty of our men and 38 of theirs were killed instantly, with another 222 wounded. Dead too was the U.S. commander, Pike. The British also set fire to The Isaac Brock (docked near the present-day Union Station). Since the U.S. didn't capture the ship or seize any of the ammunition (their main goal of this particular campaign) why did they bother to advance on the town of York? It was done in revenge for their losses, and in particular, for the looting that accompanies a town once captured. It's what armies do. The U.S. marched on along present-day Lake Shore Blvd., up to the town's boundary at Front and Peter. The town of York sat in silent but terrified wait. With the fires of the garrison, the burning of The Isaac Brock and the huge explosion still fresh in the residents' minds, the soldiers continued their march along Front, crossed Yonge Street and finally reached the town core itself. At Church and King, they began their looting and pillaging the stores, taking whatever they could carry off. At Jarvis, where the Town Hall stands today, they ransacked the fish and meat shops and gathered up all the whiskey they could drink. All along King Street, no store was left untouched. Furniture, tableware, linens, tobacco, carpenters' tools, surgical instruments, huge amounts of sugar, flour, and soap were emptied from their shelves. The little library (the first in York), the one we were so proud of, was ransacked of all of its books. Houses were burned; jails were thrown open and livestock butchered. A few nights into the occupation, a group of U.S. sailors were seen loitering around the area of King and Berkeley. Moments later the nearby Parliament buildings were on fire and consequently burnt to the ground. Would there be no end to this barbaric intrusion? To be fair, there were some U.S. soldiers who were disgusted with their comrades' actions and stood guard in front of people's houses. As the legend goes, when the soldiers thought they would loot and ransack the then St. James Church, John Strachan said 'Enough!' Dressed head to toe in black, the Reverend of St. James, astride his horse on the steps of his church, demanded that the U.S. forces get out of town and pay, pound for pound, the damage they had inflicted. Amazingly, the U.S. General Dearborn, exhausted from vomiting all week due to seasickness, agreed, helplessly, in front of this imposing figure. The U.S. army withdrew from York, and the legend of John Strachan was created. York was saved from the tyranny of American Democracy. The British way of life was spared for the time being. It would be a long time before the people of York would forget the occupation by U.S. forces. The year after the U.S. burned the Parliament buildings, the British torched their President's home. They painted it white and have called the White House ever since. Losses on both sides were staggering, but it was to be the First Nations who lost the most. Fifteen thousand of this continent's original settlers, more than the combined total of British and U.S. forces, were wasted, and a promise of a permanent homeland (now Upper Michigan) forever vanquished.",,Conflict,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: Sir Francis Bond Head, a handsome, accomplished, adventuresome, former cavalry officer who had fought beside Wellington at Waterloo, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada in 1836. Legend says it was a misprint on an official document that brought Sir Francis over from England, as it was his cousin, Edmund, who really was in line for the job. In honour of the new Governor, James Bell, being a staunch Tory, renamed his Coopers Inn tavern on Church Street the Sir Francis Bond Head Inn. At first, Sir Francis, who lived in the Governor's mansion on the site of present-day Roy Thompson Hall, was willing to listen to reformers like William Lyon Mackenzie and they, in turn, were happy to have Sir Francis as Lt. Governor, because his predecessor, Sir John Colborne, was a member of the much-despised ruling elite, the so-called Family Compact. However, Sir Francis stopped listening to the reformers and started to side with the elite after realizing it was they who could give him what he really wanted: power. In order to keep in the good books with the Family Compact, Sir Francis called an election after dissolving the assembly and, just to make sure the Tories (the Family Compact party of choice) won, he decreed that only men who owned property could vote. Immediately thereafter, Sir Francis issued hundreds of land deeds (along with free booze) to anybody who would vote Tory. That one act of disgusting largess was to be a turning point in Canadian history. Soon whispers of a rebellion began to seep out from the taverns, hotels, theatres and coffee shops that once lined our streets, with the loudest murmur coming from inside the Mackenzie camp. On Monday, December 4, 1837, rebels started gathering at Montgomery's Tavern, now near the corner of Eglinton and Yonge Streets, where food and other supplies were to be organized. Men from outlying communities began to arrive in small and large groups, but no precise numbers are known. Beginning at nightfall on December 5th, 1837, the infamous government-backed fighting force known as the McGraw Troupe rode en mass down Church Street to the Sir Francis Bond Head Inn, where they dismounted, stabled their horses in a barn behind the Inn, downed a few pints, made their plans for the following day, and went to bed. The next morning, Wednesday, December 6th, 1837, the McGraw Troupe, all saddled up, galloped down Colborne Street and went on to meet up with Sir Francis and his 1000 volunteers. With the Union Jacks billowing in the wind and their fife and drum band reverberating patriotic tunes, they headed up Yonge Street to meet Mackenzie's men. The proposed march down Yonge Street by Mackenzie was planned as an attempted revolution to seize the arms and ammunition that were stored in Toronto's then city hall, now the site of St. Lawrence Hall, and use those weapons to force the government to surrender in a bloodless coup. During the week of the rebellion more than 700 men would arrive at Montgomery's Tavern, although it is estimated no more than 500 rebels were gathered together at any one time. Colonel Moodie, with six other loyalists, attempted to ride through the rebel roadblock to warn Governor Bond Head in Toronto. Moodie fired his pistol, apparently over the heads of the rebels, the opening shot in the rebellion in Upper Canada. A number of the rebels returned fire, killing Moodie. But now Mackenzie hesitated rather than striking directly into the city. This gave Governor Bond Head a chance to organize. The lack of action also led to more desertions from the rebel side. On Thursday, December 7th, Anthony van Egmond, a veteran military commander, arrived to be the military leader of Mackenzie's rebellion. Immediately, he realized the rebel forces on hand were desperately insufficient and advised an urgent withdrawal. Instead, Mackenzie remained and awaited the government counterattack. Fellow rebel Peter Matthews was given 60 riflemen and sent to the Don River Bridge as a diversion, but they were driven off. The main rebel force left at the tavern numbered just 400, with only 200 of those with firearms. In the distance, bagpipes could be heard announcing the approaching government forces. A brief exchange of gunfire occurred, but the heavily outnumbered rebels fled after a few minutes, suffering numerous dead and wounded. Mackenzie escaped to the hills and on to the United States, as did many other rebels. And so ended the Rebellion of 1837 here in Upper Canada. In the aftermath of the Rebellion came a Tory reign of terror with 25 rebels executed in Upper Canada and 12 men in Lower Canada (Quebec). The patriots of Upper Canada were either shot or hanged here in Toronto, London and Niagara-on-the-Lake with 150 more sentences to banishment in Van Damien's Land, now Tasmania, and to Sydney, Australia. And to the victors? Huge celebrations back at the Sir Francis Bond Head Inn for a job well done. In reality we the people did eventually win when, in 1848, fellow reformer Robert Baldwin successfully introduced Responsible Government into Canadian Parliament where, for the first time, the Government would be responsible to the people rather than the other way around.",,Conflict,,,Plaque,0.0

Barker's 50 victories make him the fourth ranking ace in Canada (seventh in the Empire), and his awards for gallantry make him the most decorated serviceman in the history of Canada, the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations.This bronze tribute represents the historic first meeting between these two Canadian heroes. Although the exact date of the meeting is unknown, it is said to have taken place in early 1919 when Barker was recovering in a London hospital from the serious injuries sustained in his historic aerial battle of October 27, 1918, just days before the end of hostilities on November 11, 1918.Bishop and Barker became steadfast friends. They moved to Toronto after the Great War where they began one of North America's first aviation charters called Bishop-Barker Aeroplanes Ltd, operating a fleet of flying boats from Toronto Harbour. The airline faded three years later but each continued to enjoy successful careers in aviation.Barker went on to become the acting Director of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) at its formation in 1924.

By the end of the battle, U.S. forces suffered 320 dead and wounded while York's casualties numbered about 157.Garrison Common survives as part of the original 1793 Military Reserve lands cleared for use by the British Army around the fort. As part of a broader fortification system, army engineers created unobstructed defensive fields around forts. In the case of Fort York, ""The Common"" gave the watchful eyes of the fort's sentries a clear view of the lands west of the fort.In peacetime, military commons were shared with the civilian population for public gatherings and sporting events. Open, level fields were well-suited to equestrian events and shooting competitions.

Here's what they say: About 600 years ago, this was the site of a vibrant village of 800 to 1000 people, ancestors of the Huron-Wendat nation. Though their name for this place is lost, their village was discovered under a farmer's field and named the Alexandra site in 2001. In a lengthy excavation, archaeologists revealed evidence of longhouses, sweat lodges, and garbage pits. Nearly 20,000 artifacts were documented and collected from the site before it was developed as a residential subdivision. No human burials were found.Among this site's artifacts were beads made of sea shells from the eastern seaboard - proof that the people here were linked to extensive trading networks. This was also an agricultural community surrounded by cultivated fields of corns, beans, squash, sunflower, and tobacco. Remains of deer, lake trout and wild berries, among other animals and wild plants, indicate that hunting, fishing and gathering also supported the community. The village's location on a small ridge above a waterway (now the altered Highland Creek) provided it with fish and fresh water.Constructed without palisades, the aboriginal village excavated here was probably not threatened by extensive warfare. Its people lived together as extended families in sixteen longhouses, the earliest of which were built at the site's southern edge. Later houses were added to the north, while the older longhouses were frequently rebuilt throughout the site. Likely used to communicate with the spirit world, sweat lodges were social venues which may have helped to form and maintain relationships between newcomers and residents.Over the roughly 40 years of their stay here, the people of this village eventually exhausted the surrounding land of its nutrients and resources. As was their custom, they then moved to another site, leaving this one to return to meadow and forest. Carefully documented, the Alexandra site and its artifacts highlight the long history of human habitation in what is now the City of Toronto.",,First Nations,,,Plaque,0.0

Here's what it says: In a park that once housed a tannery, the first Wychwood car barns were built in 1913, with additions in 1916 and 1921. During these years, public transportation was vital to many Toronto neighbourhoods, due to the rationing of gasoline and tires, and the prohibition of automobile production.As the oldest TTC buildings still kept in their original form, they illustrate the City's public transportation history. They were in fact, built by the City's newly formed Toronto Civic Railway Company because the privately-owned Toronto Railway Company refused to provide more service to the expanding city territory.From a heritage perspective, the car barns are an excellent example of early 20th century industrial architecture - which was reflected in the surrounding neighbourhoods of Hillcrest, Bracondale and Wychwood Park. Though the car barns were closed in 1978, they continued to be used as a test site for modern streetcar models, and the Scarborough Rapid Transit line.Protected under a heritage agreement, the car barns will continue to be a neighbourhood landmark as the Artscape Wychwood Barns, a .5 ha community arts and environmental centre.",,Culture,,,Plaque,0.0

 A priest of the Congregation of St. Basil and a leading figure in higher education, Father Carr promoted the creation of Catholic colleges at secular universities in Canada. In the early 1900s, he modernized the St. Michael's College curriculum, turning a small institution into a noted arts college, fully federated with the University of Toronto. A champion of this model, he went on to head similar Catholic institutions at the University of Saskatchewan and British Columbia.

The storm killed 81 people, left 1868 families homeless, and caused extensive property damage. International and local donations to a flood relief fund assisted victims, and all three levels of government shared the expenses of paying for property damage and removing houses located in floodplains.

Of these, nearly 40,000 passed through Toronto, a city of some 20,000. Many thousands died on the ""coffin"" ships on the journey from Ireland to Canada. Many more died at the quarantine station at Grosse Île, a small island northeast of Quebec City. From Grosse Île and Quebec City, immigrants came by steamship to ports along the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario. In the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus in the fever sheds erected by the Toronto Board of Health at the northwest corner of King and John Sts. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. Immigrants landed at the foot of Simcoe Street. The healthy were assisted out of the city as soon as possible; the sick were treated in hospital or at the Fever Sheds. They were allowed to stay a maximum of six days, receiving a daily ration of three-quarters of a pound of bread and meat. Survivors were sent to the Convalescent Home at the corner of Bathurst and Front Sts. Most of the dead were buried beside St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church at Queen and Power Sts.

The school was named after the famous medieval Italian poet, Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), the author of the epic poem, “The Divine Comedy”.
 
The Dante Alighieri Academy of 1974 consisted of 180 students, nine teachers, a relocatable and two portables. In 1976 a permanent building was completed and by 1979 the final addition was completed.
 
Through the years, Dante Alighieri Academy has offered a wide range of programs at the advanced and general levels. The school is also the centre of studies for TCDSB's deaf and hard of hearing students.
 
In 2005, Global Architects Inc added a 10,000sf arts pavilion addition to the high school’s existing facility to meet the new arts focused curriculum. The addition features two wings – one for performing arts and one for visual arts. Each wing consists of an open studio environment that can be divisible into smaller focus areas. The performing arts wing includes spaces for vocal and instrumental music and drama. In its open format, the space acts as a 300-seat performance space complete with an elevated stage.
The project also features passive solar control measures such as horizontal sunscreens and expansive roof overhangs.
In 2017, CS&P Architects and partners unveiled the design for the new shared-use facility for the Columbus Centre/Villa Charities and Dante Alighieri Academy Redevelopment.

Prior to this date the original structure was a two-storey wood frame building. Its exterior is in excellent condition and its Edwardian style is the only edifice left of its kind between Trinity and Sackville Streets. Located on the eastside of Gilead Place, #18 Eastern Avenue, is a heritage bookend structure to âlistedâ row houses located at the north end of Gilead Place, numbers 457-461 King Street East (part of Wilkins Row). 

The history of Eastern Avenue, especially that of the area east of Trinity Street, is associated with the Macedonians, and people of Balkan origin, whose history in Corktown during the early 1900s is documented.  By 1905, approximately 500 Macedonians, Bulgarians and other people of Balkan origin were living in Corktown, and by 1910, the number of such settlers to Toronto had doubled. Many of these people worked in nearby factories while others operated businesses throughout the neighbourhood including mom-and-pop storefronts along Eastern Avenue.  Deeply committed to their religion and culture, Corktownâs Macedonian community raised money to establish a church at Trinity and Eastern Avenue in 1910. 

Mr. Haji D.Peroff, founding member and owner of 18 Eastern Avenue, played a key role in the purchase of the church property. Hence, to demolish #18 Eastern Avenue, at the north-east corner Eastern Avenue and Gilead Place (former â H.D. Peroff â grocery store), will erase a significant part of Corktownâs built and cultural history.

The heritage attributes of the building are found on the exterior walls and roof.

On the six-bay principal (east) facade, the main entrance is located at street level in the right (north) bay. A round-arched stone portal with a multi-paned transom is decorated with an oversized hood mould, carved spandrels, a name plaque, and a date stone. Narrow rectangular openings are paired in the basement level beneath a thick stone band course. 

The horizontal emphasis is continued in the first floor where a continuous stone sill connects the large flat-headed window openings. Above a stone cornice, the upper two stories are divided vertically by a sequence of thick and thin brick piers with stone coping. The piers separate narrow flat-headed window openings and create a varied silhouette at the flat roof. The finishing cornice is decorated with stone rondelles and shield motifs.

Hamilton Townsend was OAA president, opposed to TorontoÂ´s Architectural Eighteen Club Reference, Contract Record, volume 14, Sept 1903

It was determined that the architect for no. 138 Madison, was Hamilton
Townsend, not Jocelyn Davidson as attributed by Patricia McHugh who also mistakenly named the house Rivermead. McHughâs information conflicts with the
1903 Contract Record [Toronto], vol. Xiv, 16 September 1903, which indicates the
house at 138 Madison as designed by architect S.H. Townsend. Gardiner descendants cleared the confusion.

The International Harvester Building is architecturally significant for its Art Moderne design.
Located on the east side of Bathurst Street between Wellington Street West and Portland Street,
the building is a contextual landmark in the King-Spadina neighbourhood. The heritage attributes of the building are found on the exterior walls and roof with attention
focused on the principal (west) faÃ§ade and side (north and south) elevations. The two-storey
structure features a streamlined plan with rounded corners and flat roofs, smooth wall surfaces
interspersed with expanses of glass, and the use of contemporary materials. The single-storey
nearly square base consists of banks of multi-paned showroom windows on the south and west
walls and garage doors on the north elevation. Above the openings, sections of tiled siding wrap
around the walls. On the west facade, the horizontal emphasis is countered with the introduction
of a central recessed entrance (formerly clad with glass blocks). In the second storey, the red
brick and tile surfaces are broken by a series of rectangular openings on the north and south
elevations and by a multi-paned horizontal ribbon window on the west wall. A decorated metal
spar rises above the flat roof.",Art deco,,,,Building,0.0

The church is now on Churchill Avenue.
The Toronto Catholic District School Board acquired 1 Botham Road to accommodate a 425 pupil place, K-8 Elementary School on the site of a former Anglican convent. The derelict building which was demolished in 2007 was located at the border of Central Toronto and the region of North York. The site is 11.9 acres, however only 5.8 acres of the site are developable, where the remaining portion of the site is designated as part of the open space system. 1 Botham road is a hidden ""gem"" in the middle of the Yonge & Sheppard community. The site offers a large variety of vegetation and wildlife, and sits on the peak of the City's largest ravine (Don Valley). 
The design of the building takes the approach of a pavilion nestled amongst the mature trees. The footprint of the building is broken up to address the various programs (Community, School, Kindergarten) and limit the impact of the footprint on the site. The design of the school is also quite exciting in its approach to integrating a Community Hub which will be available to the neighbourhood for use beyond the scheduled school hours.",Contemporary,,2013.0,2010.0,Building,0.0

Competition
In 1905, the City of Toronto opened a competition for Canadian Architects to submit designs for the new library. It was to be built as part of a $350 000 grant from Andrew Carnegie for four new libraries in Toronto, along with Yorkville (1907), Queen and Lisgar (1909), and Riverdale (1910). This was the largest of Toronto’s Carnegie libraries.
The winning architect would be given the commission for the building, and the customary 5% commission rate on the cost of the building. The cost allotted for the building was $260 000, and the competition programme made several specifications for the building, such as being built of fire-proof material, high ceilings, and large windows. It also stated that is should be designed with future additions in mind.
Winning Design 
19 plans were submitted to the competition, and Wickson & Gregg and A.H. Chapman’s design was selected as winner in 1906. Their design was a Neo-classical building; the symmetrical façade had entrances on each end of the College St. side of the building. Classical elements in the interior include columns, rounded arches, and ornate ceilings.
The cornerstone to the building was laid on November 27, 1906 and it opened to the public in September 1909.
Addition
In 1928-30, an addition by Chapman & Oxley (in association with Wickson & Gregg) was constructed.
Heritage Desingation
It was listed as a heritage property in 1973 and designated under the Ontario Heritage Act Part VI in 1975.
New Use
In 1977, the reference library was moved to its current site just north of Yonge and Bloor Streets. After some renovations, the former library building became part of the University of Toronto, and now houses the Koffler Student Service Centre and the university’s bookstore.",Classical revival,,1909.0,1900.0,Building,0.0

The program called for the traditional planning to be re-interpreted with the church group to develop a modern interpretation of the traditional planning and finishes of a church into a new modern and inclusive setting in a much smaller space. The planning is centred on promoting inclusiveness and social interaction from the entry signage to the actual physical space to the modern audio video features for online services and outreach to those that cannot attend for various reasons.

In a note to ACO President, architect Annabel Vaughan noted ""This is a beautiful little gem of a pavilion....would be a shame to bastardize it."" ACO President Catherine Nasmith wrote to the Councillor´s office to express concern about the facing of the columns in stone, the loss of the stone washroom facilities. Executive Assistant Mary Campbell responded that the concerns had been shared with Parks staff, and that ""staff will implement as they deem appropriate.""

- One of about half a dozen custom built homes designed by Henry Fliess in the Donalda area of Don Mills.
-Original house was 2100 square feet with four bedrooms
- The house had been preserved (both inside and out) in its original style, decor and colour palette. It is an interesting, rare and well documented time capsule of 1950s living.
- The house interplays with the natural aspect of the site with the way it was thoughtfully built into the slope of the ravine it rests on. The use of wood (cedar siding) and stone on the exterior pay respect to the notion of being intertwined with nature.
 
 
The house has subsequently been stripped of its woodwork and stonework, undermining having it listed or designated. It has been nominated for designation by a private citizen.",Modernist,,1957.0,1950.0,Building,0.0

1922: In June, the cornerstone of the building was laid. The building was not ready until November, so classes began in September in Birch Cliff Congregational Church. Reginald H. King was the first principal. When first opened, the school was known as Scarborough High School.

It was a two-storey building with 8 rooms that opened to serve 480 students. An 1897 addition added a kindergarten. In 1898, a third floor with an additional four classrooms was added to this building. 

1913: A 3-storey building with 17 rooms was built with a budget of $17 000 as an extension to the 1887 building. Six rooms were added in 1923 and joined the 1887 and 1913 buildings. 

1950: The 1887 building was demolished. 

1964: Toronto Board of Education decides to construct a new building rather than renovate the old one. An additional 1.68 acres is purchased for the site at a cost of $549 999.30. 

1965: Drawings prepared and tenders received; construction began in May. The older buildings (1887 & 1913) were demolished.

1966: Students were able to occupy some rooms on the first floor by May, although construction on the rest of the building was ongoing. Official opening was on November 21. The building consisted of more than 30 classrooms, an auditorium/gymnasium, and library. Even though newly built, portables were needed to accommodate all the students.

1978: New Lunch room built on first floor.


1983: New playground structures constructed.

Ketchum had previously donated land in 1832 for a school which was built at McMurrich Street and Davenport Road. Overflow from this original 1832 school meant that girls were taught across the street at Ketchum Hall, a Temperance Hall built by Ketchum. 

In 1856, he donated the land for the current site to build a âFree and Common School.â In 1858, a four-roomed school was built on the site and accommodated both male and female students. However, soon overcrowding became an issue and Ketchum Hall was once again used for overflow. 

In 1875, two rooms were added, and in 1878 a three-story addition was built. Yorkville Trustees bought the land to the west of the school to use as a playground. In 1883, Yorkville was annexed to Toronto and the Board voted to rename the school âJesse Ketchum School.â In 1889, the first two-room addition (from 1875) was replaced with 8 rooms. A fire in 1904 destroyed part of the additions, but the main building was largely undamaged. 

Construction on the current building began in 1915 but was delayed due to the First World War. In 1917, the Recruits Deport of the Royal Flying Corps used the school building as a barracks, and the neighbouring park as a parade and sports ground. The building returned to school use in 1920.

In 1958, the school accommodated approximately 1000 students in 31 rooms. That year, a major expansion was built upon the 1915 building, which added a gymnasium, assembly room, art room, science room, cafeteria, music room, speech and drama room, and new lighting. The formal opening of the renovated school occurred on September 29, 1958.

The former War Amps building has design value as a rare example of a headquarters-manufacturing building designed to integrate a cenotaph-like element in the Modern Classicism style. Favoured by public institutions and conservative corporations, Modern Classicism was applied to this building designed for the employment of Canadian war amputees manufacturing their key tags and for their national headquarters.

The design value is evident in the high degree of artistic merit seen in the combination of minimal and linear classical details, traditional materials such as limestone cladding, modern materials and elements such as polished black granite, curtain walling and the cast metal handrails which exhibit the combined influence of Streamlined Art Deco and 1950s automobile styling. Further, the tall, single, limestone-clad fluted pier at the west end of the principal (south) elevation of the building has a quality evocative of a cenotaph, appropriate in honouring the sacrifice made by the war amputees in service to their country. The building with its highly visible cenotaph-like stone pier, originally displaying the War Amps emblem, is set back and viewed across the open space in front of the building and on approach from Yonge Street.

The property has associative value with the War Amps organization, founded in 1918 by veteran amputee and army padre Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Lambert, O. B. E. (1886-1971), who remained the president of War Amps until his death and was a persistent advocate for veterans. To honour him, the former Christie Street Military hospital was re-named Lambert Lodge. The War Amps received its charter in 1920 as an organization of ""amputees helping amputees"" with both practical assistance and counselling. Their now nation-wide, key tag service was initiated in 1946 as a means for veterans to achieve independence through employment. The War Amps has expanded their services to include adults and children who have lost their limbs from causes other than war.

The property is also valued for its association with the Toronto architect Charles B. Dolphin (1888-1969), known for many fine landmark buildings in the city including the Postal Delivery Building (1939-1941).

Contextually, the War Amps building is valued as it contributes to maintaining the mid-century character and low-rise scale of the buildings fronting onto the north side of Merton Street between Yonge Street and Pailton Crescent. The building is historically linked to its surroundings as it was part of post-war transformation and re-development of the street following the completion of the Yonge Street subway line.",Modern classical,,1959.0,1950.0,Building,0.0

The original location of the cabin was near where Queen St. crosses the Don Valley Parkway. A plaque erected in 2003 by the Riverdale Historical Society marks the original building.
John Scadding (1754-1824), secretary to Governor John Graves, came to York (Toronto) in 1793. Simcoe granted him 250 acres on the east bank of Don River, south of Kingston Road. It was on this land that the cabin was constructed, built by the Queen’s Rangers in 1794. It is a two-story, square-timbered construction from hewn logs.
Scadding returned to England in 1796 and upon returning to York in 1818, sold the cabin and part of his land to William Smith Jr. The Smith’s used it as an outbuilding for their farm.
In August 1879, owner John Smith donated the building to the York Pioneers. The group dismantled the building, transported it, and rebuilt it on the Industrial Exhibition grounds (now the Canadian National Exhibition). It is not known how the building was transported to its current site, although some suggest it may have been floated down the Don River and along the shoreline of Lake Ontario. On August 22, 1879 the York Pioneers rebuilt the cabin and, according to newspapers, were finished by 5pm. The cabin was opened as a museum and is still open every day during the CNE.
In 1909, the cabin’s interior and exterior were whitewashed, a practice that continued regularly until the 1950s. While the exterior is no longer white, the interior logs remain so. In 1959, a cement sub-floor was created for the cabin to sit upon.
The cabin was designated a heritage building by the City of Toronto in 1989. As the property is over 200 years old, its condition had deteriorated over time. Heather & Little were hired to replace the cedar shingle roofing. The team worked to make the replacement shingles as historically accurate as possible; #1 Blue Label Western Cedar Shingles were used. At the same time, masonry repairs on the chimney were completed by Colonial Building Restoration of Toronto.
The building had often been referred to as ‘Simcoe’s Cabin,’ perhaps because of a misunderstanding of the original occupant. The building’s current name- Scadding Cabin- is in honour of Henry Scadding (John Scadding’s son), who was a founding member and president of the York Pioneer Historical Society. A plaque detailing the history of the cabin was erected in 2012 by Heritage Toronto at the cabin’s current site.",Log construction,,1794.0,1790.0,Building,0.0

Until the early 1980’s the school served only the local community. At this time, due to declining enrollment, it became the Scarborough school for French immersion. This change led to a growth in the student population, resulting over time, in the arrival of 10 portables to go with the original 11 room building. As the population grew, the community (lead by parents and teachers) began to lobby for an addition to replace the portables. After many years of hard work and persistence, they were successful. In the spring of 2011, construction began on a 10 room addition. This included a kindergarten pod to accommodate the arrival of Full Day Kindergarten. On February 13th, 2012, students and teachers, some of whom had spent the better part of their career teaching in a portable, were finally able to move into their new building.

The actual street address was 380 Mortimer Avenue. The original one-storey brick schoolhouse, which used an estimated 55,000 bricks and 6,200 floor tiles, had its official opening on April 12, 1944. The building consisted of four classrooms, office and two cloakrooms; an auditorium and two teachers’ lunch rooms were on the basement level. The new address was 299A Donlands Avenue beside Holy Cross Church.
An addition was made in 1948. This second-storey consisted of four classrooms, a lunchroom for the lay teachers, a nurse’s office, a sewing room, and a sitting room. The two classes that had been in the auditorium were moved upstairs.
In 1949, a Kindergarten-primary class was begun. In 1954, on November 22nd, a new portable was opened on the school property to accommodate twenty-seven Grade 3 pupils. By 1961, there were 4 portables on the property.
On January 23, 1963, the Toronto Metropolitan Separate School Board received tentative approval for the addition of ten classrooms (replacement of four) at a proposed cost of $200,000 and excavations began during the Easter holiday period.
In September of 1963, school opened with an enrolment of 635 students and a staff of twenty-one teachers. Construction of the new wing was not yet completed. In October, eight classes moved into the new addition, but the basement rooms weren’t yet ready and teachers had to make do, since no teachers’ desks or chairs had arrived. 
An Open House and Blessing of the new wing by Father Miller was held on Sunday, March 1st, 1964. But construction was not quite finished! In June of 1966, plans were submitted for the “Phase 2 Addition” to the school, which was to include two more classrooms, a library and a general purpose room. The budget was $125,000. The Government of Ontario gave the School Board a grant of $80,000 towards the cost. The addition was completed in 1967.",Modernist,,1944.0,1940.0,Building,0.0

Originally, the parish was to be named after St. Charles. According to historical records, however, the first school--a small wooden structure--was named St. Mary's.
In 1890, the school was replaced with a brick building and renamed St. Cecilia's. Legend has it that St. Cecilia, the patron saint of sacred music, was chosen as the new name because the Heintzman Piano factory stood in view, across the railway tracks, from the school. The present St. Cecilia's Church, at the corner of Annette Street and Pacific Avenue, was opened in 1909, replacing a smaller structure first occupied in 1895. Father Eugene Gallagher was the pastor.
The present St. Cecilia Catholic School, at the corner of Annette Street and Evelyn Avenue, opened in 1914 with additions in 1918, 1954 and 1964. The school's first teachers and administrators were the Loretto Nuns, who lived in the former Heintzman family residence at Annette and Laws Streets, providing another musical connection with St. Cecilia.",Modernist,,1914.0,1910.0,Building,0.0

The school is located on a quiet side street off St Clair Ave. It is a well-maintained facility, with spacious classrooms and three separate play areas – one for kindergarten children, one for the primary and junior grades and one for intermediates and seniors. The school board, the City of Toronto, and the parent council have been working together over the last few years to redevelop the property surrounding the building.
